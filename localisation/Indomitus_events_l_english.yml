Radicals believe such forces can be exploited when the ends justify such means.. All sects of the Inquisition seek the favor of the Senatorum Imperialis, upon which their broad mandates and theological legitimacy rely."

imperium_events.5.d:0 "The unimaginable has come to pass. The Golden Throne, the arcane mechanism sustaining the Emperor's fragile essence and lighting the Astronomican, has failed. Its intricate machinery lies in ruin, its golden luster dulled to lifeless metal. Terra, once the unassailable heart of the Imperium, descends into chaos. The bonds that once held this sacred world together snap, leaving its surface a storm of anarchy and despair. The proud bastion of humanity is abandoned, its desolation a stark reminder of the Imperium's greatest failure. Without the Golden Throne, the Imperium is rudderless. The Emperor’s silence reverberates through all, and the heart of mankind’s dominion lies bare for the taking. Will Terra ever rise again, or has humanity’s light been extinguished for all eternity?"
