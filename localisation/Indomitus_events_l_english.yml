Radicals believe such forces can be exploited when the ends justify such means.. \nAll sects of the Inquisition seek the favor of the Senatorum Imperialis, upon which their broad mandates and theological legitimacy rely."

The bonds that once held this sacred world together snap, leaving its surface a storm of anarchy and despair. \nThe proud bastion of humanity is abandoned, its desolation a stark reminder of the Imperium's greatest failure. Without the Golden Throne, the Imperium is rudderless. The Emperor’s silence reverberates through all, and the heart of mankind’s dominion lies bare for the taking.

They came back, from up out of the ice, and we shed much blood to put them back beneath it. We are Ultramarines. The exemplars. Our victories are many, but against the enemy on Damnos we tasted that rarest of things, a word I thought lost to our vocabulary ; §defeat§.
