admech_forge_world.1.desc:0 "By the grace of the Omnissiah our rust-red banners fly above the hive cities of a fallen forge world. After a long and brutal battle our Skitarii legions are marching through the smoldering ruins of manufactoria and worker habs, eliminating the last pockets of resistance. While the fighting comes to an end, our magos logi are gathering to discuss the future of this world. Rebuilding the great forges and restoring the original production capacities will be costly, both in ressources and time, but it will greatly increase value of this world both to the Adeptus Mechanicus and the Imperium."
