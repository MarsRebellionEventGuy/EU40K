 Genestealer_Mission_3_desc:0 "Though the cult's military might is considerable due to its vast number of Hybrids, they remain underequipped without access to sophisticated weaponry.

Equally as beneficial is the Kelermorph's exploitation of mortal psychology to sow terror and chaos among a cult's enemies."

Each leads the most powerful organizations of the Imperium, ranging from the prestigious offices of the Admininistratum and Ministorum to the enigmatic yet essential Assassinorum. Their ambitions have led some to think themselves irreplacable, going so far as threatening to obstruct the Indomitus Crusade in their gambits for power.
