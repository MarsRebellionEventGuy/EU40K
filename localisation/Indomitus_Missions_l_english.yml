 Genestealer_Mission_1_title:0 "Initiate Locus Bodyguards"
 Genestealer_Mission_1_desc:0 "The Genestealer Patriarch is essential to the cohesiveness of a cult, maintaining the Brood Mind used to unite its Hybrids. Producing Loci, Hybrids created for the purpose of guarding the Genestealer Patriarch, would prevent their potential assassination."
 Genestealer_Mission_2_title:0 "Bolster Acolyte Hybrids"
 Genestealer_Mission_2_desc:0 "Imperial citizens inducted into a Genestealer Cult eventually produce Hybrid offspring, Tyranid bioforms capable of performing specific tasks. Their numbers must be bolstered in preparation for an eventual military takeover."
 Genestealer_Mission_3_title:0 "Stockpile Weapons"
 Genestealer_Mission_3_desc:0 "Though the cult's military might is considerable due to its vast number of Hybrids, they remain underequipped without access to sophisticated weaponry. Raiding Imperial barracks and training Hybrids with the acquired weaponry will allow the cult's armies to rival that of the Imperium."
 Genestealer_Mission_4_title:0 "Mythologize Kelermorph"
 Genestealer_Mission_4_desc:0 "The Kelermorph is a Genestealer Hybrid which serves as a figure of legend and revolutionary hero. Tales of its exploits inspire all segments of a world's population to seek out the Kelermorph's Genestealer Cult and join its ranks. Equally as beneficial is the Kelermorph's exploitation of mortal psychology to sow terror and chaos among a cult's enemies."
 Genestealer_Mission_5_title:0 "Convert the Masses"
 Genestealer_Mission_5_desc:0 "Worlds in which Genestealer Cults operate must be sufficiently devoted to the Hive Mind before the Day of Ascension arrives. The masses must be converted to the cult's ways and integrated into the Brood Mind."
 Genestealer_Mission_6_title:0 "Launch the Uprising"
 Genestealer_Mission_6_desc:0 "Though the cult's influence has grown considerably, overt control of its worlds remain under the control of Imperial governors. A revolution is necessary to place their resources under the direct control of the Patriarch."

 Genestealer_Mission_9_title:0 "Interplanetary Diplomacy"
 Genestealer_Mission_9_desc:0 "The cult has infiltrated its worlds' diplomatic cadres, allowing it to make contact with other worlds. Such communications allow plentiful vectors for Genestealer infiltration."
 Genestealer_Mission_10_title:0 "Infiltrate Voidships"
 Genestealer_Mission_10_desc:0 "Genestealers are capable of infiltrating the cargo holds of manned spacecraft, further spreading their influence. Capable of surviving in the void of space, the cult may even gain access to a space hulk. These large spacefaring wreckages are capable of transporting large numbers of Genestealers to new worlds and may wield significant military power."

Its remote position has led to the periodic emergence of seperatists and cultists, all of which must be culled for the Imperium to reestablish control. Just as it was conquered by Lord Militant Angevin several millenia prior, it shall be reclaimed for the Imperium once more."

 XXA_Mission_13_desc:0 "Consisting of tens of thousands of nobles, dignitaries, and other officials, the Senatorum Imperialis is a governing body responsible for representing the manifold institutions of the Imperium. Countless in number but serving little purpose, many have grown corrupt in the absence of the Emperor's guidance. The dismissal of these bureaucrats, enforced through the barrel of a bolter if need be, is essential to reversing the Imperium's longstanding stagnation."
 XXA_Mission_14_title:0 "Route the Heretics"
 XXA_Mission_14_desc:0 "The warbards of the Word Bearer traitor legion have sown much discord among Terra's neighboring systems, exploiting the disruption of the Astronamican during the Noctis Aeterna to spread the influence of Chaos. The Imperium must drive them out of its worlds and remind its people of the Imperial Creed."
 XXA_Mission_15_title:0 "Secure Core Systems"
 XXA_Mission_15_desc:0 "The Segmentum Solar is has been the most well-defended and essential region of the Imperium of Man, with Humanity's radiant throneworld of Terra at its center.

 XXA_Mission_16_title:0 "End the New Kingdom"
 XXA_Mission_16_desc:0 "Through the profane rituals of Magnus the Red, the Thousand Sons Traitor Legion have transported their homeworld of Sortiarius from the Warp into realspace. Orbiting the primarch's birthplace of Prospero, previously razed during the Horus Heresy, the Thousand Sons then began drawing in powerful psykers across the Imperium to join their New Kingdom and escape persecution.

Each leads the most powerful organizations of the Imperium, ranging from the prestigious offices of the Admininistratum and Ministorum to the enigmatic yet essential Assassinorum. Their ambitions have led some to think themselves irreplacable, going so far as threatening to obstruct the Indomitus Crusade in their gambits for power. Such treasonous bureacrats must be removed from power, one way or another."
 XXA_Mission_28_title:0 "Launch the Crusade"

 XXA_Mission_29_title:0 "Necromunda Ultimatum"
 XXA_Mission_29_desc:0 "Necromunda is one of the Imperium's foremost Hive Worlds in the Segmentum Solar and a major producer of munitions for the Imperial Guard. Governed by six Clan Houses under the arbitration of the ruling House Helmawr, the planet has maintained enough cohesion to sustain arms shipments to Terra. The Noctis Aeterna has since broken this uneasy peace and prompted civil war between the noble houses. They must be reminded of their fealty to the Emperor."
