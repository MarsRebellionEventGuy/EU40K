 imperium_regency_reform: "Imperial Regency"
 imperium_regency_reform_desc: "The Imperium of Man is ruled by primarch of the Ultramarines and Imperial Regent, Roboute Guilliman.

preserve_highborn_privileges_reform: "Preserve Highborn Privileges"
preserve_highborn_privileges_reform_desc: "It would be unwise and foolish to oppose the High Lords of Terra, who have selflessly taken the heavy burden of governance upon their shoulders since time immemorial. For this reason, it is imperative we preserve their hard-earned rights in the upcoming age of reform."

elevate_tribal_leaders_reform: "Elevate Tribal Leaders"
elevate_tribal_leaders_reform_desc: "Tribal warfare, altough barbaric in nature, can provide a welcome breath of fresh air to our stagnant and rigid military structure, it is thereby wortwhile to elevate the best among these rudimentary leaders to our chain of command."

distribute_warrants_of_trade_reform: "Distribute Warrants of Trade"
distribute_warrants_of_trade_reform_desc: "There is much profit to gain by adopting an increased mercantile stance within our currently rudimentary economic framework. By expanding the issuance of Warrants of Trade, we can foster a more dynamic quid pro quo between Rogue Traders and the state."

restructure_senatorum_reform: "Reestructure the Senatorum"
restructure_senatorum_reform_desc: "At its core, the Senatorum Imperialis should act as a meritocratic council of able minded individuals who share Guilliman's vision for mankind. Behind us lay the days of hereditary corruption and nepotism that plagued us for aeons; going forward we will present a united front against our pletora of enemies."

extend_primarchs_scourge_reform: "Extend Primarchs Scourge"
extend_primarchs_scourge_reform_desc: "The Senatorum has forfeited all credence of legitimacy. Its record of corruption and malpractice renders it untrustworthy, with no assurance that such abuses will not resurface. Its authority must be curtailed further into the role of a ceremonial body, little more than a rubber stamp for the policies of our great Lord Commander."

empower_departmenta_exacta_tithes_reform: "Empower Departamento Exacta Tithes"

enforce_codex_astartes_reform: "Enforce Codex Astartes"
enforce_codex_astartes_reform_desc: "'The warrior who acts out of honour cannot fail. His duty is honour itself.

Seek honour as you act, therefore, and you will know no fear' -Roboute Guilliman \n The Codex Astartes was conceived as a sacred compendium of the tactics, moral behaviour and discipline that the chapters ought to uphold within their ranks. Enforcing its teachings means forging warriors of unbreakable will in the face of the most abject terror."

integrate_cadian_diaspora_reform: "Integrate Cadian Diaspora"
integrate_cadian_diaspora_reform_desc: "To unite the scattered sons and daughters of Cadia is to preserve a legacy forged in the fires of unyielding defiance. Their discipline and battlefield prowess, once the Imperium’s bulwark against the tides of damnation, now strengthen its wider war machine. With their integration, the lessons of Cadia endure, their indomitable spirit prevails, and its reforged warriors march once more, an unbroken testament to the world that fell, but never yielded."

indomitus_fleets_reform: "Indomitus Fleets"
indomitus_fleets_reform_desc: "The Indomitus Fleets are a manifestation of the Imperium's resolve to reclaim lost worlds and reinforce its authority across the galaxy.

solblades_reform_desc: "The Solblades are elite vessels that embody speed, agility, and precision in void warfare.

autonomy_for_ophelia_reform: "Autonomy for Ophelia"
autonomy_for_ophelia_reform_desc: "We acknowledge the unique position of Ophelia VII, a vital world  entirely devoted to the teachings of the Imperial Creed.

promote_omnissiah_reform: "Promote Omnissiah"
promote_omnissiah_reform_desc: "We reaffirm our syncretic commitment to the Omnissiah, the Machine God worshipped by the Adeptus Mechanicus of Mars.

With their unconditional support, we vastly reduce the costs associated with governance improvements."

permit_imperial_truth_reform: "Permit Imperial Truth"
permit_imperial_truth_reform_desc: "Humanity cannot let itself get splintered from within in these trying times. We have therefore instructed the Inquisition to stop the active persecution of believers of the so-called 'Imperial Truth'.

adeptus_custodes_reform: "Favor the Adeptus Custodes"

ultramarines_cadre_reform: "Ultramarine Cadre"
ultramarines_cadre_reform_desc: "If there is one thing a xenos fears more than a Space Marine, it is an Ultramarine, who sits at the top echelon of this already prestigious cadre of elite soldiers. By incorporating these elements into our military administration, we ensure access to a wide selection of expert veterans who provide invaluable advice on current and future campaigns in the void. Furthermore, by integrating their strategies and principles into our military structure, we can enhance our operational effectiveness and ensure that their legacy of leadership becomes an integral part of our armed forces."

navigator_patronage_reform: "Navigator Patronage"
navigator_patronage_reform_desc: "The invaluable role of the Navigators in the expansion of our reach across the stars cannot be understated.

chartist_captains_reform: "Chartist Captains"
chartist_captains_reform_desc: "The Chartist Captains are commanders of the state-owned merchant fleet of the Imperium, which unlike the Rogue Traders, do not possess the nearly limitless power of a Warrant of Trade, instead given rights over specific sectors. However, they can access the political scene by becoming full members of the Senotorum; perhaps that is an idea we should further entartain..."

rogue_trader_domains_reform: "Rogue Trader Domains"
rogue_trader_domains_reform_desc: "If we were to further enshrine the Warrants of Trade as a mercantile carte-blanche we would benefit from a noticeable increase of our trade volume and efficiency of overall commerce, altought likely at the cost of unforeseen consecuences down the road."

extend_tithes_reform: "Extend Tithe System"
extend_tithes_reform_desc: "The current Tithe mechanism of resource extraction has become outdated, old privileges and exemptions have rendered a significant chunk of our planets virtually useless in war contributions, this cannot stand any longer. A new and improved mechanism of tributation would ensure an improved and streamlined funneling of resources from previously morose sections of our demesne."

empower_high_lords_reform: "Empower High Lords"
empower_high_lords_reform_desc: "With the Emperor confined to the Golden Throne, the High Lords of Terra wield immense power over the Imperium’s governance.

rule_by_astartes_reform: "Rule By Astartes"
rule_by_astartes_reform_desc: "In a state of perpetual war, it would be foolish not to integrate the armed forces directly into our government.

guilliman_authority_reform_desc: "There is no denying it, Guilliman holds full command of the Imperium. Guidance is needed more than ever, for the Emperor’s capacity to govern is severely constrained, with no end in sight. Granting greater powers to the Regent would establish an uncompromising rule, one capable of enacting the desperate reforms we so urgently require."

emperor_authority_reform: "Emperor's Primacy"
emperor_authority_reform_desc: "Despite Guilliman's apt governance, we must not forget who truly commands the Imperium, he who sits in the golden throne, the target of bilion of prayers and the light of the Astronomican itself. To rule mankind is a heavy task, the hefty weight of history cannot be made to bear by any one man, only a god can."

astartes_authority_reform: "Astartes Supremacy"
astartes_authority_reform_desc: "Politics on Terra mean little when you're locked in battle with the Archenemy.

golden_throne_repair_reform: "Golden Throne Repair"
golden_throne_repair_reform_desc: "The Golden Throne, the life-support system for the Emperor, is the cornerstone of our Imperium’s stability. Tragically, it has remained in a state of ruin and disrepair for far too long. We must prioritize its repair and maintenance, allowing the cunning of our Emperor to imbue our future direction of the Imperium. Furthermore, we can apply the lessons learned during the repair of the throne to other great endeavours in our realm."

galactic_domination_reform: "Galactic Domination"
galactic_domination_reform_desc: "The time has come to rise and claim our rightful place as masters of the galaxy.

imperial_webway_network_reform: "Imperial Webway Network"
imperial_webway_network_reform_desc: "It is time to ressucitate the great millenia-old Webway Project of the Emperor himself.

This fanatical movement infiltrates society, with members across all levels, workers, soldiers, and governors preparing for the day of ascension when their masters arrive. \n Ruled by the Patriarch, whose psychic influence connects the cult to the Tyranid Hive Mind, its hierarchy includes the cunning Magus and battle-hardened Primus. Each sermon and skirmish aims to undermine their world and deliver it to the Great Devourer. To outsiders, they are a mindless threat; to their followers, they are the chosen, destined to usher in a new galactic order."

drukhari_cult_reform_desc: "A Kabal is a gathering of like-minded individuals, operating much like a warband. It recruits from across the city, luring new members in with promises of gold, glory, and the thrill of Realspace raids. When the Kabal musters its strength and surges from the Webway, it descends upon the unsuspecting victims of the cosmos, whoever they may be, in the feared soul-harvesting operations that embody our kind."

haemonculi_coven_reform_desc: "Deep within The Dark City dwell the Haemonculi Covens, feared even among fellow Drukhari, these deranged flesh-sculptors are entrusted with extracting the psychic essences of the souls taken in the raid all over the galaxty. Their dominion of both body and soul allows them to furnish a new body should a Drukhari fall in battle, making them a neccesary evil in our twisted society."
