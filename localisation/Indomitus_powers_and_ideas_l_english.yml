 Craftworld_ideas_bonus:0 "Asuryani Ambition"
 Craftworld_ideas_1:0 "The Ai’elethra"
 Craftworld_ideas_1_desc:0 "The Ai'elethra is a codified set of traditions which nullify the Eldars’ intense emotional resonance and protect their spirits from Slaanesh. Individual Asuryani dedicate themselves to specializations, ranging from artisanship to martial prowess."
 Craftworld_ideas_2:0 "Psychic Proficiency"
 Craftworld_ideas_2_desc:0 "Using their latent psychic potential in their daily lives, the Asuryani are naturally gifted psykers. The most long-lived and adept among them are the Farseers, who are able to navigate potential futures to direct the trajectory of their civilization towards advantageous outcomes."
 Craftworld_ideas_3:0 "Aspect Warriors"
 Craftworld_ideas_3_desc:0 "Asuryani who master the Path of the Warrior may choose to become Aspect Warriors, adopting a combat specialization which embodies an aspect of the Aeldari war deity, Khaine. Aspect Warriors may eventually pursue another profession in accordance with the Ai’elethra or become an Exarch, masters of combat representing the pinnacle of Eldar martial prowess."
 Craftworld_ideas_4:0 "Wraithbone Construction"
 Craftworld_ideas_4_desc:0 "The Asuryani are able to crystallize psychic energy into wraithbone, a resilient material which they can influence and manipulate at will. Specialized craftsmen known as Bonesingers are able to use wraithbone to construct anything from starships used in Asuryani fleets to the artificial Wraithguard constructs which form the bulk of their shock troops."
 Craftworld_ideas_5:0 "Rise of the Ynnari"
 Craftworld_ideas_5_desc:0 "The emergence of the Ynnari, a religious sect centered around Yvraine and avatar of the Eldar death deity, the Yncarne, has sent waves throughout Asuryani society. The group's emphasis on unity among the Asuryani, Eldar Corsairs, Drukhari, and Exodites has led to greater ties among the remnants of Aeldari civilization."
 Craftworld_ideas_6:0 "Wisdom of the Infinity Circuit"
 Craftworld_ideas_6_desc:0 "Each Asuryani craftworld holds an Infinity Circuit, a wraithbone matrix containing the spirit stones housing its dead. These spirits are still capable of advising living Asuryani, providing them with the collective wisdom of Eldar civilization."
 Craftworld_ideas_7:0 "Recovery of the Spirit Stones"
 Craftworld_ideas_7_desc:0 "The Asuryani house their dead inside spirit stones to protect them from being devoured by Slaanesh. The birth of new Eldar and limited supply of stones necessitates dangerous expeditions to crone worlds, former centers of the ancient Aeldari civilization which are now largely located within the Eye of Terror."

 Exodite_ideas_bonus:0 "Exodite Ambition"
 Exodite_ideas_1:0 "Renouncers of Decadence"
 Exodite_ideas_1_desc:0 "Before the fall of the Eldar, those who would become the Exodites denounced the decadence and hedonism of their species. While they were denounced as narrow-minded and zealous at the time, it is this foresight that allowed the Exodites to be spared from the fates of their brethren."
 Exodite_ideas_2:0 "Survival as a Choice"
 Exodite_ideas_2_desc:0 "The Exodites intentionally chose to settle harsh worlds where life would be hard. It is this emphasis on survival above all else that binds Exodite society."
 Exodite_ideas_3:0 "Honorable Warfare"
 Exodite_ideas_3_desc:0 "Full-scale wars between Exodite clans are rare, and when they do occur it is universally accepted that to despoil or steal the crops of a rival tribe would be an act of dishonor. Such norms ensure that tribes rarely maintain rivalries for long."
 Exodite_ideas_4:0 "Protection of the World Spirits"
 Exodite_ideas_4_desc:0 "At the heart of every Exodite world is a World Spirit composed of deceased Eldar spirits. These gridded matrices of stone menhirs, obelisks, and stone circles crafted from psychoactive crystals are not unlike the Infinity Circuits of the Asuryani. The importance of the World Spirits in sheltering the Exodite dead from the predation of Chaos has led to a heavy emphasis on their defense."
 Exodite_ideas_5:0 "Dragon Knights"
 Exodite_ideas_5_desc:0 "Exodite life is closely linked to the domestication of giant reptiles known as megadons, relying on them for food, skins, and bones which function as substitutes for wraithbone. The Dragon Knights are Exodites who are able to ride such creatures, and play an integral role in the protection of their communities."
 Exodite_ideas_6:0 "Integration of the Asuryani Outcasts"
 Exodite_ideas_6_desc:0 "The Exodite societies are a common destination for Asuryani Outcasts since they are notably less hostile to outsiders and those who forsake the Asuryani Path than the Craftworld Aeldari. Often these rogue Asuryani seek the patronage of one of the Exodite tribes. They bring skills the Exodites value highly, and so are always made welcome at the courts of the tribal Aeldari."
 Exodite_ideas_7:0 "Webway Transportation"
 Exodite_ideas_7_desc:0 "The links between the Exodites’ crystal standing stones form a part of the Aeldari Webway. This enables Aeldari to move between the craftworlds and the Exodite Maiden Worlds, with interlinking paths over the Exodite worlds themselves."

 Hiveworld_ideas_start:0 "Hive World Traditions"
 Hiveworld_ideas_bonus:0 "Hive World Ambition"
 Hiveworld_ideas_1:0 "Empower Planetary Defense Forces"
 Hiveworld_ideas_1_desc:0 "Each major Imperial world maintains Planetary Defense Forces, militias under the control of the local government responsible for maintaining stability as well as continued loyalty to the Imperium. Expanding and standardizing such forces would provide a professional standing army capable of independently defending worlds."
 Hiveworld_ideas_2:0 "Enforce Social Stratification"
 Hiveworld_ideas_2_desc:0 "Hive cities are characterized by a rigid hierarchy in which civilians are rarely able to change their social status. Exploiting such structures would ensure that a hive world operates efficiently."
 Hiveworld_ideas_3:0 "Purge the Underhive Cults"
 Hiveworld_ideas_3_desc:0 "The lowest sections of a hive are inhabited by all manner of cults which prevent the enforcement of law and order. Purging these groups would ensure that the underhives remain unable to mobilize insurrections."
 Hiveworld_ideas_4:0 "Archaeotech Scavenging"
 Hiveworld_ideas_4_desc:0 "The collapsed sections of a hive which have remained untouched for millennia may contain large caches of archeotech, artifacts from the Dark Age of Technology far beyond the knowledge of the contemporary Imperium. Supporting expeditions into such areas would provide the hive world access to such scientific marvels."
 Hiveworld_ideas_5:0 "Court the Noble of the Spires"
 Hiveworld_ideas_5_desc:0 "A hive's spires, the topmost sections of the city, are home to the world's most wealthy and powerful. Courting favor with the noble families which scheme atop the spires would put their skills in intrgue to good use."
 Hiveworld_ideas_6:0 "Support Redemptionist Mutant Hunts"
 Hiveworld_ideas_6_desc:0 "Redemptionists adhere to a more radical interpretration of the Imperial Creed which emphasizes the purging mankind of its impurities. Their movement has become popular in underhives in response to extreme social stratification. Directing their zealotry towards psykers and other mutants would provide stability to the underhives while eliminating potential sources of unrest."
 Hiveworld_ideas_7:0 "Enhance Generatorium Maintenance"
 Hiveworld_ideas_7_desc:0 "Generatoria, also known as plasma reactors, are generators designed by the Adeptus Mechanicus to power the entirety of a hive's operations. Understanding how these complex machines operate and potentially improving their performance would enable hives to operate at a much greater scale."

 Xeno_ideas_bonus:0 "Xeno Ambition"
 Xeno_ideas_1:0 "Xenotechnological Innovation"
 Xeno_ideas_1_desc:0 "Maintaining a long history of minimal contact with other species has allowed xeno civilizations to develop a unique approach to technological development. The exotic nature of xenotechnological weaponry to the galaxy’s primary civilizations prevents them from effectively developing effective countermeasures."
 Xeno_ideas_2:0 "Crisis Coalitions"
 Xeno_ideas_2_desc:0 "Xeno civilizations are prone to maintaining flexible economic arrangements, forming coalitions only when faced with overwhelming shared threats."
 Xeno_ideas_3:0 "Resistance to Chaos"
 Xeno_ideas_3_desc:0 "The majority of alien races in the galaxy do not have the psychic potential of the Elder and mankind. This renders them less susceptible to the influence of chaos."
 Xeno_ideas_4:0 "Renowned Mercenaries"
 Xeno_ideas_4_desc:0 "The unique physiology and weaponry of xeno civilizations render them appealing mercenaries throughout the galaxy."
 Xeno_ideas_5:0 "The Cold Trade"
 Xeno_ideas_5_desc:0 "The unique and often advanced nature of the technology used by xeno civilizations render their inventions highly prized among the Imperium’s nobles and Rogue Traders, with a covert illicit market known as the Cold Trade developing around the trade of xenotech."
 Xeno_ideas_6:0 "Navigator Ties"
 Xeno_ideas_6_desc:0 "Though the Imperium as a whole maintains a genocidal approach towards xeno civilizations, there exist certain segments of Imperial society open to diplomatic exchanges. A particularly invaluable contact has been the Navis Nobilite, with Navigators providing outsiders access to the Imperium’s extensive navigational data."
 Xeno_ideas_7:0 "Galactic Expansion"
 Xeno_ideas_7_desc:0 "The Tyranids hive fleets on the fringes of the galaxy have threatened the homeworlds of many xeno civilizations while the Imperium remains too preoccupied with its consolidation to protect its peripheries. Such conditions warrant territorial expansion into unprotected systems no longer under Imperial protection."

 XDJ_ideas:0 "Blood Angel Ideas"
 XDJ_ideas_start:0 "Blood Angel Traditions"
 XDJ_ideas_bonus:0 "Blood Angel Ambition"
 XDJ_ideas_1:0 "Revenant Legion"
 XDJ_ideas_1_desc:0 "The Blood Angels were known as the Revenant Legion prior to being united with their primarch, Sanguinius. They earned this title by virtue of their reputation for securing victory against seemingly insurmountable circumstances."
 XDJ_ideas_2:0 "Sanguinius' Rage"
 XDJ_ideas_2_desc:0 "While Blood Angel primarch Sanguinius was renowned for his nobility, such virtues were marred by periodic bouts of rage. The psychic imprint of the primarch’s death at the end of the Horus Heresy has since imprinted such tendencies, now known as the Black Rage, to the Blood Angels as a whole."
 XDJ_ideas_3:0 "Prolonged Lifespans"
 XDJ_ideas_3_desc:0 "The Blood Angels are long-lived, even among space marines with lifespans numbering in the hundreds. The Blood Angels’ Chapter Master, Dante, holds the title of longest-lived space marine and occupied the position for over a millenia."
 XDJ_ideas_4:0 "Imperial Shock Troops"
 XDJ_ideas_4_desc:0 "The Blood Angels were almost peerless in their rapid pacification of worlds, rivaled only by the World Eaters. Their fiery temperment made them ideal shock troops in the Emperor's campaigns of conquest."
 XDJ_ideas_5:0 "The Sanguinor"
 XDJ_ideas_5_desc:0 "The Blood Angels are watched over by the Sanguinor, a mysterious entity which appears during their times of greatest need. Whether the Sanguinor is a member of the Blood Angels' Sanguinary Guard empowered by the will of the Emperor or a purely psychic construct as theorized by the Inquisition, it remains certain that the Sanguinor exemplifies the nobility of Sanguinius."
 XDJ_ideas_6:0 "Artistic Pursuits"
 XDJ_ideas_6_desc:0 "While previously known for their barbarism and savagery, the Blood Angels have since become renowned scholars and artists under the direction of Sanguinius. Such refined pursuits provide them with purpose beyond their role as instruments of war."
 XDJ_ideas_7:0 "Legacy of the Silent King"
 XDJ_ideas_7_desc:0 "Though the Blood Angels once fought with the the Necrons' Silent King, Szarekh, an invasion by the Tyranids prompted an alliance of convenience to annihilate the shared threat. Though the Blood Angels could have attacked the weakened Necrons, their sense of honor prevailed."

 XYG_ideas:0 "Thousand Sons Ideas"
 XYG_ideas_start:0 "Thousand Sons Traditions"
 XYG_ideas_bonus:0 "Thousand Sons Ambition"
 XYG_ideas_1:0 "Rubric of Ahriman"
 XYG_ideas_1_desc:0 "The majority of the Thousand Sons have been reduced to Rubricae, unthinking automata spawned from a flawed ritual intended to cure the rampant mutations that had long plagued the legion. Despite such consequences, those who survived the Rubric of Ahriman were granted unprecedented power and wield the Rubricae as instruments for their own ends."
 XYG_ideas_2:0 "Splendor of Tizca"
 XYG_ideas_2_desc:0 "The city of Tizca was once known for its beauty. Though the city’s majestic spires have been replaced with disfigured obelisks and mighty pyramids given way to crystalline earth-matter, a glimmer of its former splendor remains."
 XYG_ideas_3:0 "Libraries of the Arcane"
 XYG_ideas_3_desc:0 "The realm of Magnus has always been one of unrestricted learning and scholarship. The Great Library of Tizca and various other pyramid complexes on Sortiarius contain much of the Thousand Sons’ collective knowledge."
 XYG_ideas_4:0 "Psychic Planetary Defenses"
 XYG_ideas_4_desc:0 "The Thousands Sons do nott rely on conventional planetary defenses. Powerful illusions and psychic barriers defend its worlds from orbital bombardment. Such precautions have allowed the realm of Magnus to grow despite its proximity to Imperial space."
 XYG_ideas_5:0 "Psyker Haven"
 XYG_ideas_5_desc:0 "Psykers have faced persecution across the Imperium for millenia. Those who aren’t killed immediately are sacrificed daily in the hundreds to sustain the Emperor, rarely getting the opportunity to reach their true psychic potential. Magnus values the most powerful of these psykers, calling them to Sortiarius and inviting them to seek knowledge within its libraries. The weakest are sacrificed to accelerate humanity’s psychic evolution."
 XYG_ideas_6:0 "Corrupted Manufactora"
 XYG_ideas_6_desc:0 "The realm of Magnus maintains substantial ties to the Dark Mechanicum, enabling the convergence of psychic and industrial power. This ensures the many Rubricae of the Thousand Sons are fully armed."
 XYG_ideas_7:0 "Tower of the Cyclops"
 XYG_ideas_7_desc:0 "Dwarfing all other towers on Sortiarius is Magnus’ own Tower of the Cyclops. Its great glowing eye penetrates through the Warp and places the entire galaxy under the watchful gaze of the Red Cyclops. If a promising psyker or arcane artifact attracts the primarch’s interest, a raid from the Thousand Sons is sure to follow."

 XGF_ideas:0 "T'au Ideas"
 XGF_ideas_start:0 "T'au Traditions"
 XGF_ideas_bonus:0 "T'au Ambition"
 XGF_ideas_1:0 "T'au Caste System"
 XGF_ideas_1_desc:0 "T'au society is divided into a number of castes, each responsible for managing a specific aspect of their civilisation. The T'au's central motivating ideal is that everyone in their empire, regardless of their species or culture of origin, will work for the collective betterment of everyone else, an almost mystical philosophy that is embodied in the Greater Good."
 XGF_ideas_2:0 "Rapid Technological Development"
 XGF_ideas_2_desc:0 "T’au civilization is characterized by its rapid technological advancement, spurred by its collaboration with other xeno civilizations and absence of taboos surrounding research. The T’au are also capable of reverse-engineering advanced xeno technology, achieving faster-than-light travel through the AL-38 Slipstream Module by modifying Imperial and Kroot ships."
 XGF_ideas_3:0 "Psychic Resistance"
 XGF_ideas_3_desc:0 "The T’au possess faint soul signatures which prevent them from developing psychic powers. This nonetheless protects them from the predation of chaos which have long plagued the societies of the Eldar and Imperium."
 XGF_ideas_4:0 "Mont'Ka and Kauyon"
 XGF_ideas_4_desc:0 "The T’au’s considerable range of vision in the electromagnetic spectrum and a predilection for patience have led to a preference for long-range combat and predetermined engagements. This doctrine is exemplified through their strategies of Mon’Ka and Kauyon, respectively translating to “killing blow” and “patient hunter” in the T’au language. The former refers to a carefully planned attack designed to wipe out critical enemy forces in a single well-placed strike, while the latter entails luring adversaries into carefully prepared killing zones for an ambush."
 XGF_ideas_5:0 "Fifth Sphere of Expansion"
 XGF_ideas_5_desc:0 "The T’au Empire organizes its territorial enlargement into distinct Spheres of Expansion. While the previous Fourth Sphere of Expansion faced complications due to non-T'au auxiliaries disrupting the empire’s attempts at Warp-based travel, the Fifth Sphere shall decisively integrate the Chalnath Expanse."
 XGF_ideas_6:0 "Ethereal Compulsion"
 XGF_ideas_6_desc:0 "Members of the T’au’s leading caste, the Ethereals, are able to compel other castes and species to focus on the Greater Good. The nature of this ability remains mysterious, but may be the result of pheromone or psychic-based influence  related to a diamond-shaped bony ridge unique to Ethereal physiology."
 XGF_ideas_7:0 "Gue'vesa Defectors"
 XGF_ideas_7_desc:0 "The T’au Empire contains a growing population of Gue’vesa, former humans of the Imperium of Man. While a considerable number of these humans are captured military personnel, many Imperial worlds are enticed by the ideological appeal of the Greater Good and willingly join the empire."

 Necron_ideas_bonus:0 "Necron Ambition"
 Necron_ideas_1:0 "Ancestral Claims"
 Necron_ideas_1_desc:0 "Though the Necron lords rule from crownworlds few in number, their former domains once stretched across the vast borders of the former Infinite Empire. Though many of their former worlds are now inhabited, they shall be expelled one way or another."
 Necron_ideas_2:0 "Gauss Technology"
 Necron_ideas_2_desc:0 "Ceramide. Adamantium. Wraithbone. The fledgling civilizations of the galaxy still rely on digging these minerals from the ground and fashioning them into primitive armor. None are capable of resisting the Necrons’ gauss weaponry, capable of reducing matter to atoms. Combustion and directed energy weapons are not satisfactory for the Necrons, who seek nothing short of total obliteration for their opponents."
 Necron_ideas_3:0 "Slumbering Tombs"
 Necron_ideas_3_desc:0 "The bygone Infinite Empire of the Necrons once ruled much of the galaxy following their victory over the Old Ones. Though the number of active Necrons may be few, there exist plentiful worlds with slumbering tomb complex waiting to be awakened"
 Necron_ideas_4:0 "Deathmarks"
 Necron_ideas_4_desc:0 "The Deathmarks are the Necrons’ most skilled assassins and snipers. Wielding their civilization’s most advanced spatial manipulation technology, Deathmarks travel and strike their targets via pocket dimensions. Once marked, their target would be lucky to survive more than a few seconds before being torn apart by a synaptic disintegrator."
 Necron_ideas_5:0 "Dynastic Rivalries"
 Necron_ideas_5_desc:0 "The Necrons have changed much from their previous biological existence as the sickly, short-lived warriors of the Necrontyr. One thing that has nonetheless remained immutable is the civilization’s pride and loyalty to clan ties. The passage of aeons have done little to dull the plentiful rivalries between the various Necron house. Millenia of technological advancement have only made the pursuit of such blood feuds all the more ruthless and efficient."
 Necron_ideas_6:0 "Intertialess Drive"
 Necron_ideas_6_desc:0 "While the spawn of the Old Ones rely on unreliableand rigid methods of travel via the Warp or Webway, the Necrons have had millenia to perfect the intertialess drive. This method of faster-than-light travel takes place entirely in realspace, allowing Necron fleets to not only travel large distances but also make short-range jumps across battlefields in bursts of relativistic energy."
 Necron_ideas_7:0 "Blackstone Mastery"
 Necron_ideas_7_desc:0 "The formation of the Great Rift has led to the galaxy’s younger civilizations to begin their rudimentary experimentations with blackstone. While they try in vain to tamper with forces they don’t understand, they haven’t remotely begun to reach the level of mastery the Necrons wield over the substance. Countless Necron megastructures of unrivaled complexity may be found across the galaxy, protecting its fledgling races from threats they are unable of perceiving. Blackstone was the foundation of the Infinite Empire’s marvels, and it shall be the tool the Necrons use to once more assert their rule."

 Astartes_ideas:0 "Astartes Ideas"
 Astartes_ideas_start:0 "Astartes Traditions"
 Astartes_ideas_bonus:0 "Astartes Ambition"
 Astartes_ideas_1:0 "Codex Astartes"
 Astartes_ideas_1_desc:0 "Long divided by disparities in doctrines and modus operandi, space marines have since operated under standardized procedures in accordance with the Codex Astartes. Written by primarch Roboute Guilliman to pass down the wisdom of space marines past, the treatise contains everything from unit markings to planetary assault procedures."
 Astartes_ideas_2:0 "Emphasize Successor Chapter Ties"
 Astartes_ideas_2_desc:0 "The Codex Astartes divided the nine loyalist space marine legions, previously numbering in the tens of thousands, into individual successor chapters of limited size. This has not prevented the shared heritage which binds successor chapters from sustaining amicable fraternal ties."
 Astartes_ideas_3:0 "Primaris Reinforcements"
 Astartes_ideas_3_desc:0 "The creation of Primaris marines has enabled space marine chapters to reach unprecedented rates of growth. There initially existed backlash towards these reinforcements, with many Firstborn astartes being wary of their chapter’s cultures being supplanted by outsiders. Necessity and the ever-present threat of retaliation from the Adeptus Custodes have nonetheless led to the gradual integration of these reinforcements. Many Firstborn have since crossed the Rubicon Primaris to benefit from the upgrades of their newer peers as well."
 Astartes_ideas_4:0 "Expand Chapter Serfdom"
 Astartes_ideas_4_desc:0 "The Astartes are too few in number and too essential in the Imperium’s conduct of war that the maintenance of their infrastructure and weaponry has been delegated to chapter serfs, servants indentured to their space marine chapters. They may be drawn from eligible aspirants or the children born from preexisting serfs."
 Astartes_ideas_5:0 "Reclusiam Relics"
 Astartes_ideas_5_desc:0 "The Astartes’ fortress-monasteries each contain a Reclusiam, a chamber dedicated to holding relics of importance to its space marine chapter. The spiritual head of a chapter, the Master of Sanctity, integrates these relics into their chapter’s unique traditions and beliefs."
 Astartes_ideas_6:0 "Cooperation with Fleet-Based Chapters"
 Astartes_ideas_6_desc:0 "Many space marine chapters do not operate from a homeworld, instead maintaining a large fleet with a mobile fortress-monastery. While some chapters become fleet-based following the destruction of a former homeworld or its forfeiture as penance for treason, others have been fleet-based since their creation. These chapters often lack access to new recruits, enabling opportunities for collaboration with chapters maintaining established homeworlds."
 Astartes_ideas_7:0 "Maintain Forge World Supply Lines"
 Astartes_ideas_7_desc:0 "Safeguarding communications and supply lines with the Adeptus Mechanicus is essential to the functioning of any space marine chapter. Astartes remain reliant on Forge Worlds to sustain their supply of weaponry, ammunition, power armor, vehicles and starships. It is the Adeptus Mechanicus’ genetors which study a chapter homeworld’s native population for potential mutations which may impact its quality of aspirants."

 Genestealer_ideas_1:0 "Patriarch Loyalty"
 Genestealer_ideas_1_desc:0 "All Genestealers are psychically connected to their cult’s oldest purestrain, known as a Patriarch. This role allows them to wield the unquestioning loyalty of a cult’s Hybrids."
 Genestealer_ideas_2:0 "Space Hulk Infiltration"
 Genestealer_ideas_2_desc:0 "Genestealers are able to rapidly infest new planets by infiltrating voidships and large, spacefaring collections of ship debris known as space hulks. The mass displacement caused by the formation of the Great Rift has further accelerated the Genestealers’ proliferation."
 Genestealer_ideas_3:0 "Brood Intelligence"
 Genestealer_ideas_3_desc:0 "Communication between genestealers takes place telepathically through a Broodmind, reflecting a weaker version of the gestalt consciousness of the Tyranids themselves. This enables cultists to act as a cohesive unit despite their remaining individuality."
 Genestealer_ideas_4:0 "High Society Ties"
 Genestealer_ideas_4_desc:0 "Genestealer cults are able to operate with impunity by building large networks of loyalty among a planet's governors and aristocracy."
 Genestealer_ideas_5:0 "Interspecies Infection"
 Genestealer_ideas_5_desc:0 "Though humans remain ideal candidates for Genestealer infection due to the significant population density of hive worlds, genestealers cults may take root among almost any spacefaring civilizations. Feral Orks are also viable for infection, as are the Tau, Eldar, Kroot, Vespid, and Hrud. Genestealers are also capable of infecting and mutating animals when no suitable sapient species are available, though the resulting mutations render them unsuitable for reabsorption into the Tyranid Hive Mind."
 Genestealer_ideas_6:0 "Covert Operations"
 Genestealer_ideas_6_desc:0 "Genestealer Cults develop comprehensive intelligence networks used to sabotage military assets and subvert planetary governments. Such operations are used to weaken a world’s defenses in preparation for the arrival of the Tyranid hive mind."
 Genestealer_ideas_7:0 "Military Infiltration"
 Genestealer_ideas_7_desc:0 "The more powerful and ambitious of Genestealer Cults are able to directly infiltrate Astra Militarum regiments to stockpile ammunition and access a greater pool of recruits. The frequency of abhumans such as Ogryns and Ratlins in the Imperium's military forces allows Hybrids to operate openly."

 Iron_Warriors_ideas_2_desc:0 "The Iron Warriors specialized in sieges during the Imperium’s Great Crusades, excelling in the complete destruction of static defenses. This role led to a rivalry with the fort-building Imperial Fists legion, a relationship which facilitated their turn to Chaos."
 Iron_Warriors_ideas_3:0 "Legacy of the Iron Cage"
 Iron_Warriors_ideas_3_desc:0 "Despite their responsibilities pertaining to siegecraft under the Imperium, the Iron Warriors’ military acumen rendered them masterful defensive strategists almost equal their Imperial Fist rivals. This potential was exemplified during the Iron Cage Incident, during which the Imperial Fists were drawn into an ambush on the planet of Sebastus IV which almost annihilated the legion alongside their primarch, Rogal Dorn."
 Iron_Warriors_ideas_4:0 "The Corpse Grinders"
 Iron_Warriors_ideas_4_desc:0 "The Iron Warriors’ are famed for their methodical application of overwhelming force. When attrition alone could not win a siege, Perturabo’s sons applied their exceptional skill in close-quarters combat in a storming of a breach. The lack of a surrender grew to became preferable, as it vindicated the Iron Warriors’ complete decimation of defending armies."
 Iron_Warriors_ideas_5:0 "New Mechanicum Ties"
 Iron_Warriors_ideas_5_desc:0 "A shared passion for cybernetics and experimentation has led to close ties between the New Mechanicum and Iron Warriors. This has ensured a steady supply of military equipment and engines of war."
 Iron_Warriors_ideas_6:0 "The Siege of Terra"
 Iron_Warriors_ideas_6_desc:0 "The Iron Warriors were the most invaluable traitor legion during their siege of the Imperium’s throneworld, Terra. Though eventually marginalized by Horus in preference of more expedient plans of attack, the Iron strategies of Iron Warriors’ primarch Perturabo saw significant yet incremental success in breaking down the defenses of the Imperial Palace. "
 Iron_Warriors_ideas_7:0 "Geneseed Raids"
 Iron_Warriors_ideas_7_desc:0 "The Iron Warriors are particularly aggressive in their attempts to bolster the meager manpower issues experienced by space marines tainted by Chaos.

 Raven_Guard_ideas_2:0 "Sable Brand"
 Raven_Guard_ideas_2_desc:0 "The gene-seed of Primarch Corvus Corax is subject to a flaw known as the Sable Brand, instilling them with a cold-blooded determination to fight with no regard for self-preservation. Those who experience the Sable Brand were originally organized into units known as the Shadow Killers, though the manpower issues of the Raven Guard since their near-decimation after the Isstvan V Drop Site Massacre have led to limitations on their use. Efforts from apothecaries to cure the gene-flaw are carried out in complete secrecy."
 Raven_Guard_ideas_3:0 "Trifold Path of Shadow"
 Raven_Guard_ideas_3_desc:0 "The Raven Guard's tactics are based on the Trifold Path of Shadow developed by Primarch Corvus Corax. The teachings consist of three aspects: Ambush, Stealth, and Vigilance. Mastering one Path, taught Corax, brought the possibility of victory; mastery of two rendered triumph likely, and accomplishment in all three made the foe’s defeat all but inevitable."
 Raven_Guard_ideas_4:0 "Breakers of Chains"
 Raven_Guard_ideas_4_desc:0 "The moon of Deliverance, former home of Corvus Corax, was once enslaved by the Tech Guilds of the planet Kiavahr. It was through an insurgency waged by the primarch that the people of Deliverance were freed from their chains. Liberation has since become central to the identity of the Raven Guard."
 Raven_Guard_ideas_5:0 "Guerilla Tactics"
 Raven_Guard_ideas_5_desc:0 "The Raven Guard's preference for asymmetric warfare has led to a heavy emphasis on guerilla tactics. Squads of land speeders and gunships are used to overcome opponents with superior mobility and tactical autonomy."
 Raven_Guard_ideas_6:0 "Masters of Sabotage"
 Raven_Guard_ideas_6_desc:0 "Though more associated with waging insurgencies than the covert operations conducted by the Alpha Legion, the Raven Guard are also well-versed in the arts of sabotage and assassination.

Aspirants are transported to the wilderness with no clothing or supplies, expected to find their way back to the Fang without assistance. Implanted with the Canis Helix, those undertaking the test must also resist their animalistic instincts which may turn them into feral man-wolf hybrids known as the Wulfen."

 Space_Wolves_ideas_2_desc:0 "The lost Great Company of the Corpse Renders, previously thought to be lost during the Horus Heresy, have recently emerged from the Eye of Terror. The Company holds great respect among the Space Wolves, formed from the original followers of Leman Russ. Though many of them have succumbed to the Wulfen Curse, their reintegration with the Space Wolves has given many hope that the return of Lemun Russ is imminent."
 Space_Wolves_ideas_3:0 "Defiance of the Codex"
 Space_Wolves_ideas_3_desc:0 "The Space Wolves are the most defiant among space marines in their rejection of the Codex Astartes. Attempts by the Adeptus Ministorum and Inquisition to force compliance have ended in military retaliation from the sons of Russ. The structure and norms of their successor chapters are instead founded upon Fenrisian culture, divided into twelve Great Companies larger than many Codex-compliant chapters."
 Space_Wolves_ideas_4:0 "Cautious Primaris Integration"
 Space_Wolves_ideas_4_desc:0 "Primaris marines initially faced much opposition from the Wolf Lords, who suspected them of not being true to the ways of Fenris and Leman Russ. Their willingness to undergo the Test of Morkai and increasing number of Firstborn space marines undergoing the Rubicon Primaris themselves, however, has resolved such concerns and mitigated the Space Wolves' long-standing manpower issues."
 Space_Wolves_ideas_5:0 "Rune Priests"
 Space_Wolves_ideas_5_desc:0 "The Space Wolves do not maintain traditional Librarians used in other space marine chapters, instead relying on Rune Priests for psychic combat roles and lorekeeping. Instead of drawing power from the Warp, Rune Priests are instead channel the animal spirits of Fenris through runes. This spared them from the Emperor's ban on space marine psykers following the Council of Nikaea while continuing to protect them from manipulation by Chaos."
 Space_Wolves_ideas_6:0 "Executioners of the Emperor"
 Space_Wolves_ideas_6_desc:0 "The Space Wolves were not born to govern like the Ultramarines nor build like the Iron Hands.

 Iron_Hands_ideas_2:0 "Mechanicus Ties"
 Iron_Hands_ideas_2_desc:0 "The Iron Hands, fighting pitched battles which often required advanced engines of war, have developed long-standing ties with the Adeptus Mechanicus to secure the necessary supplies.

 Iron_Hands_ideas_5:0 "Calculus of Battle"
 Iron_Hands_ideas_5_desc:0 "The logical approach of the Iron Hands to warfare is exemplified by a set of hexamathic formulae known as the Calculus of Battle. These procedures break down military conflicts as raw data where enemy actions can be predicted and balanced like an equation. The Calculus does not account for civilian casualties and may entail the cold sacrifice of individual space marine squads to achieve victory, reflecting the cold, calculating outlook of the Iron Tenth2."
 Iron_Hands_ideas_6:0 "Calculum Rationale"
 Iron_Hands_ideas_6_desc:0 "The Calculum Rationale is a process of caluclation by which the Iron Hands decide how many resources would be required to prevail in a prospective military engagement. The sons of Ferrus Manus will often refuse to participate in conflicts when the calculation indicates that they have insufficient resources to do so."
 Iron_Hands_ideas_7:0 "The Iron Council"
 Iron_Hands_ideas_7_desc:0 "The Iron Hands are unique in their lack of a single Chapter Master or an equivalent position, with authority instead being divided between the Iron Council.

The Salamanders have since developed a substance capable of generating pulses of heat detectable by fire-sight. This enables them to not only have a means of communicating via tactical markings visible only to them but also a way of rapidly identifying one another on the battlefield."
 Salamanders_ideas_2:0 "Compassion of Vulkan"
 Salamanders_ideas_2_desc:0 "Unlike many other space marines who see themselves as separate or superior to the human race, the Salamanders understand their role as protectors of mankind.

 Salamanders_ideas_4:0 "Blacksmith Training"
 Salamanders_ideas_4_desc:0 "The art of forging is integral to Salamander culture. Initiates begin as forge workers before being fully inducted while space marines themselves are fully capable of maintaining their own equipment. This leaves the most skilled of Salamander artificers free to utilize their skills in metallurgy towards greaters ends, such as the creation of personalized Artificer Armor."
 Salamanders_ideas_5:0 "Flame Weaponry"

 Dark_Angels_ideas_1_desc:0 "The Dark Angels, while maintaining their commitments to the Imperium, remain singularly focused on hunting down the Fallen. Led by Primarch Lion El’Jonson’s former mentor and father, the Fallen are Dark Angels who fell to Chaos and seized control of the legion’s homeworld of Caliban during the Horus Heresy. Though the planet was eventually scoured and Luther captured, his followers were scattered in the Warp and continue to be hunted down by the Dark Angels’ successor chapters as penance."
 Dark_Angels_ideas_2:0 "Legacy of the Order"
 Dark_Angels_ideas_2_desc:0 "The foundation of the Dark Angels is built upon the Order, an honorable band of knights from the world of Caliban responsible for hunting down the world’s hostile fauna. Following its induction of Primarch Lion El’Jonson, the Order united the planet’s knights and exterminated the Great Beasts of Caliban."
 Dark_Angels_ideas_3:0 "Secrets of the Inner Circle"
 Dark_Angels_ideas_3_desc:0 "The Dark Angels operate under multiple levels of secrecy that allow members to gradually learn more about the former legion’s origins as they rise through the ranks. Complete knowledge of the Fallen’s betrayal, however, is known only to the chapter’s Inner Circle. Such secrecy is essential to keeping their narrowly avoided fall to Chaos away from the Imperium, a transgression which the Dark Angels believe would lead to their destruction."
 Dark_Angels_ideas_4:0 "Unity Among the Unforgiven"
 Dark_Angels_ideas_4_desc:0 "Though the remaining space marine legions of the Imperium have been fragmented following the Horus Heresy, the successor chapters of the Dark Angels remain united in their hunt for the Fallen. This persisting collaboration has allowed them to rapidly mobilize against a shared threat when necessary."
 Dark_Angels_ideas_5:0 "Primordial Strain"
 Dark_Angels_ideas_5_desc:0 "The first prototype space marines were made with the highly stable Gene-seed of Dark Angel primarch, Lion E’Jonson.

 Dark_Angels_ideas_6:0 "Strategic Independence"
 Dark_Angels_ideas_6_desc:0 "The Dark Angels car little for unified space marine command councils, instead maintaining their own strategic counsel and supply lines.

 Kin_ideas_1_desc:0 "The Kin emphasize survival, borne out of necessity from their origins aboard void-borne mining fleets. Laziness and waste became reviled, with even minor lapses in vigilance resulting in insufficient supplies or repairs which could potentially endanger an entire fleet. Such concerns eventually evolved into an acquisitiveness which has led other civilizations to judge them as hoarders."
 Kin_ideas_2:0 "Wisdom of the Ancestor Cores"
 Kin_ideas_2_desc:0 "The Votann Ancestor Cores are ancient super-cogitators containing gestalt repositories of wisdom and knowledge. Originally used by early Kin mining fleets for practical mission advice, they have gradually developed a cultural significance among the Leagues of Votann. The memories of the countless generations of dead Kin being uploaded into the machines have led to their advice growing more cryptic over time."
 Kin_ideas_3:0 "Cloneskeins"
 Kin_ideas_3_desc:0 "All Kin are produced as clones, with their genetic structure being underpinned by a standardized set of mutations known as Cloneskeins. While the genetic pools of these templates are varied, they all grant the Kin traits necessary to survive near the Galactic Core such as a denser physiology, infrared vision, and a resilience to extreme environments."
 Kin_ideas_4:0 "Particle Excavators"
 Kin_ideas_4_desc:0 "The Kin are able to thrive in the Galactic Core by employing Particle Excavators to produce fusion energy from harvested newborn stars.

 Kin_ideas_5:0 "Guild Loyalties"

Guilliman's gene-seed has, however, been noted to influence the Ultramarines' predisposition towards conformity."
 XGK_ideas_6:0 "Tactical Diversity"
 XGK_ideas_6_desc:0 "The military doctrine of the Ultramarines favors tactical diversity and the application of overwhelming force.

 XGK_ideas_7:0 "First Among the Chapters"

 Tyranid_ideas_5:0 "Capillary Towers"

 Alpha_Legion_ideas_3_desc:0 "Alpha legion warbands prefer to avoid direct combat in favor of subterfuge and sabotage.

Raised amid the harsh conditions of Chemos, he quickly learned to be resourceful and charismatic, traits that helped him lead his Legion as Primarch during the Great Crusade. His descent into the Dark Prince's influence began on the conquest of Laer and culminated in his full embrace of Chaos at the fateful Battle of Isstvan V, where he slew his former brother-in-arms, Ferrus Manus. Driven by an unrelenting pursuit of perfection, our people flourish under his reign, guided by his vision of boundless ambition and beauty."
 Emperors_Children_ideas_2:0 "The Undying Past"
 Emperors_Children_ideas_2_desc:0 "We are the only so called "traitor" chapter that spared the Remembrancers in the time of Horus.

From the Siege of Terra to Isstvan and the 13th Black Crusade, Fulgrim’s influence was undeniable. Yet perhaps his most defining moment was the Battle of Thessala, where he slashed Roboute Guilliman’s throat with the aid of his generals. Unfortunately, Guilliman was revived in Ultramar not long ago. Fulgrim, however, sees no threat in this resurrection, even warning him on the day he returned. It seems Guilliman’s throat might be due for another reminder."
 Emperors_Children_ideas_5:0 "The Night on La Fenice"
 Emperors_Children_ideas_5_desc:0 "The most infamous episode in our history with the Remembrancers took place aboard the battleship La Fenice 10,000 years ago.
