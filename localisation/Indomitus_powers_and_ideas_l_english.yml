 XXA_ideas_start:0 "Imperial Traditions"
 XXA_ideas_bonus:0 "Imperial Ambition"
 XXA_ideas_1:0 "Reforms of Guilliman"
 XXA_ideas_1_desc:0 "In the wake of the Emperor’s silence, the weight of the Imperium’s present and future rests upon the shoulders of Roboute Guilliman, the newly resurrected Lord Regent. His brilliance and resolve have become the Imperium’s rudder, steering it through an era of reform to restore order to a fractured empire. Through the application of masterful administrative proficiency, the Regent enacts sweeping changes across the realms. Reorganizing the fragmented imperial bureaucracy, he strengthens the economy, modernizes the military, and rebuilds mankind’s faith in the Emperor’s vision. While his reforms meet resistance, they form the foundation of a new Imperium, one that strives to balance the demands of war with the needs of a growing empire."
 XXA_ideas_2:0 "Tenebrae Vincimus"
 XXA_ideas_2_desc:0 "The Imperium of Man stands resolute in the task ahead, fortified by the indomitable Hub Fortresses and propelled forward by the relentless Indomitus Fleets. These bastions serve as vital waypoints of the Imperium's reach and naval projection. Meanwhile, the Indomitus Fleets push humanity’s boundaries forward, their campaigns rekindling the Emperor’s light in forgotten stars. And though the darkness of the galaxy stretches far and wide, we sail forth with unwavering faith in our endeavor, for we are the flame that defies the endless night."
 XXA_ideas_3:0 "Planetary Governors"
 XXA_ideas_3_desc:0 "In the fragmented expanse of the Imperium, planetary governors are the true rulers of their worlds, tasked with governing in the Emperor's name. Their primary duty is to uphold the Emperor’s order and ensure the planet's tithes are met, but their rule extends to all aspects of life, from trade development to planetary defense. They must balance governance, diplomacy, and economic growth while guarding against external threats and internal unrest. While bound by duty to the Emperor, governors rule independently, making autonomous decisions when needed, as communication from Terra can be slow or even nonexistent. Their skill in both military and administrative matters ensures the stability of their worlds and, in turn, the Imperium itself."
 XXA_ideas_4:0 "The Rubicon Primaris"
 XXA_ideas_4_desc:0 "The Rubicon Primaris is a trial by fire, a harrowing process that transforms Firstborn Space Marines into a new breed of Primaris. Enhanced beyond human limits, these warriors possess strength, speed, and resilience unmatched by their previous selves. While the Rubicon offers unparalleled power, the process is fraught with peril. Many who undergo the trial do not survive, and those who do emerge irrevocably altered. However, for those who cross the threshold, the rewards are immense. The new Primaris are humanity’s vanguard, forged to face the galaxy’s horrors and shatter the limits of mortal strength, ushering in an era of unmatched dominance."
 XXA_ideas_5:0 "Psychic Awakening"
 XXA_ideas_5_desc:0 "In the wake of the Great Rift's creation, a powerful surge of psychic energy courses through the galaxy, awakening dormant powers within mankind. The existing psykers grow stronger, and new, untapped minds rise to prominence, often unpredictable in their potential. Though the growing number of psykers brings both hope and fear, one thing is certain; the Imperium must adapt to harness these newfound powers, for the future of humanity may be shaped by these psychic forces."
 XXA_ideas_6:0 "Imperial Tithe"
 XXA_ideas_6_desc:0 "The Imperium’s war machine and economy rest on the obligation of the Imperial Tithe. Every world, regardless of size, must contribute to the Emperor’s cause, supplying soldiers, resources, or goods. The Tithe varies; some worlds provide regiments of Astra Militarum, others raw materials or technology. The greater the world’s capacity, the larger its tribute. The Tithe is not just a tax; it is a sacred pact that binds every world of the Imperium into the unyielding march toward the galaxy’s ultimate domination."
 XXA_ideas_7:0 "Blackstone Engineering"
 XXA_ideas_7_desc:0 "The discovery of the Blackstone Pillars represents a monumental leap in humanity’s technological mastery. Once believed to be relics of a long-lost age, these immense and enigmatic structures are now beginning to unveil their secrets to the ingenuity of mankind. The Pillars’ latent power, combined with their near-invulnerability and resistance to the Warp, has proven invaluable in the Imperium’s efforts to reinforce its defenses and extend its dominion.These new assets enable us to breach previously unreachable warpspace, purging the heretics wherever they may hide."

 XXB_ideas:0 "Martian Ideas"
 XXB_ideas_start:0 "Martian Traditions"
 XXB_ideas_bonus:0 "Martian Ambition"
 XXB_ideas_1:0 "Fabricator-General of Mars"
 XXB_ideas_1_desc:0 "Although officially first among equals the Fabricator-General of Mars is both the religious head and the leader of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Nowhere is his authority stronger than on Mars itself."
 XXB_ideas_2:0 "The Ring of Iron"
 XXB_ideas_2_desc:0 "Created during the Dark Age of Technology the Ring of Iron around the equator of Mars houses countless orbital factories that endlessly produce warships the Battlefleet Solar and the Navy of the Adeptus Mechanicus."
 XXB_ideas_3:0 "Every Move Calculated"
 XXB_ideas_3_desc:0 "The armies of Mars are a truely terrifying force on the battlefield. Legions of augmented Skitarii fight in perfect coordination as they are slaved to their Magi who process billions of calculations per second."
 XXB_ideas_4:0 "The Iron Heart of the Imperium"
 XXB_ideas_4_desc:0 "The Forge Worlds are the beating heart of iron within the Imperium and without doubt the greatest among them is Mars, the Red Planet."
 XXB_ideas_5:0 "Quest for Knowledge"
 XXB_ideas_5_desc:0 "Their faith to the Omnissiah drives the techpriests of Mars to rediscover lost STC templates from the Dark Age of Technology, as well as maintain the vast amounts of knowledge they already hold."
 XXB_ideas_6:0 "Arks and Titans"
 XXB_ideas_6_desc:0 "Though through millenia of war they have become a rare sight Mars still commands archeotech as powerful as Imperator-Class Titans and vast voidships like the Ark Mechanicus"
 XXB_ideas_7:0 "The Manufactorium Must Grow"
 XXB_ideas_7_desc:0 "Lord-Regent Guilliman has declared the Indominatus-Crusade to reconquer our Galaxy and the Techpriests of Mars answer his call. The forges of Mars will increase their production to meet the demand. May our foes burn in the fires of industry."
 
 Craftworld_ideas:0 "Asuryani Ideas"
 Craftworld_ideas_start:0 "Asuryani Traditions"
 Craftworld_ideas_bonus:0 "Asuryani Ambition"
 Craftworld_ideas_1:0 "The Ai’elethra"
 Craftworld_ideas_1_desc:0 "The Ai'elethra is a codified set of traditions which nullify the Eldars’ intense emotional resonance and protect their spirits from Slaanesh. Individual Asuryani dedicate themselves to specializations, ranging from artisanship to martial prowess."
 Craftworld_ideas_2:0 "Psychic Proficiency"
 Craftworld_ideas_2_desc:0 "Using their latent psychic potential in their daily lives, the Asuryani are naturally gifted psykers. The most long-lived and adept among them are the Farseers, who are able to navigate potential futures to direct the trajectory of their civilization towards advantageous outcomes."
 Craftworld_ideas_3:0 "Aspect Warriors"
 Craftworld_ideas_3_desc:0 "Asuryani who master the Path of the Warrior may choose to become Aspect Warriors, adopting a combat specialization which embodies an aspect of the Aeldari war deity, Khaine. Aspect Warriors may eventually pursue another profession in accordance with the Ai’elethra or become an Exarch, masters of combat representing the pinnacle of Eldar martial prowess."
 Craftworld_ideas_4:0 "Wraithbone Construction"
 Craftworld_ideas_4_desc:0 "The Asuryani are able to crystallize psychic energy into wraithbone, a resilient material which they can influence and manipulate at will. Specialized craftsmen known as Bonesingers are able to use wraithbone to construct anything from starships used in Asuryani fleets to the artificial Wraithguard constructs which form the bulk of their shock troops."
 Craftworld_ideas_5:0 "Rise of the Ynnari"
 Craftworld_ideas_5_desc:0 "The emergence of the Ynnari, a religious sect centered around Yvraine and avatar of the Eldar death deity, the Yncarne, has sent waves throughout Asuryani society. The group's emphasis on unity among the Asuryani, Eldar Corsairs, Drukhari, and Exodites has led to greater ties among the remnants of Aeldari civilization."
 Craftworld_ideas_6:0 "Wisdom of the Infinity Circuit"
 Craftworld_ideas_6_desc:0 "Each Asuryani craftworld holds an Infinity Circuit, a wraithbone matrix containing the spirit stones housing its dead. These spirits are still capable of advising living Asuryani, providing them with the collective wisdom of Eldar civilization."
 Craftworld_ideas_7:0 "Recovery of the Spirit Stones"
 Craftworld_ideas_7_desc:0 "The Asuryani house their dead inside spirit stones to protect them from being devoured by Slaanesh. The birth of new Eldar and limited supply of stones necessitates dangerous expeditions to crone worlds, former centers of the ancient Aeldari civilization which are now largely located within the Eye of Terror."
 
 Exodite_ideas:0 "Exodite Ideas"
 Exodite_ideas_start:0 "Exodite Traditions"
 Exodite_ideas_bonus:0 "Exodite Ambition"
 Exodite_ideas_1:0 "Renouncers of Decadence"
 Exodite_ideas_1_desc:0 "Before the fall of the Eldar, those who would become the Exodites denounced the decadence and hedonism of their species. While they were denounced as narrow-minded and zealous at the time, it is this foresight that allowed the Exodites to be spared from the fates of their brethren."
 Exodite_ideas_2:0 "Survival as a Choice"
 Exodite_ideas_2_desc:0 "The Exodites intentionally chose to settle harsh worlds where life would be hard. It is this emphasis on survival above all else that binds Exodite society."
 Exodite_ideas_3:0 "Honorable Warfare"
 Exodite_ideas_3_desc:0 "Full-scale wars between Exodite clans are rare, and when they do occur it is universally accepted that to despoil or steal the crops of a rival tribe would be an act of dishonor. Such norms ensure that tribes rarely maintain rivalries for long."
 Exodite_ideas_4:0 "Protection of the World Spirits"
 Exodite_ideas_4_desc:0 "At the heart of every Exodite world is a World Spirit composed of deceased Eldar spirits. These gridded matrices of stone menhirs, obelisks, and stone circles crafted from psychoactive crystals are not unlike the Infinity Circuits of the Asuryani. The importance of the World Spirits in sheltering the Exodite dead from the predation of Chaos has led to a heavy emphasis on their defense."
 Exodite_ideas_5:0 "Dragon Knights"
 Exodite_ideas_5_desc:0 "Exodite life is closely linked to the domestication of giant reptiles known as megadons, relying on them for food, skins, and bones which function as substitutes for wraithbone. The Dragon Knights are Exodites who are able to ride such creatures, and play an integral role in the protection of their communities."
 Exodite_ideas_6:0 "Integration of the Asuryani Outcasts"
 Exodite_ideas_6_desc:0 "The Exodite societies are a common destination for Asuryani Outcasts since they are notably less hostile to outsiders and those who forsake the Asuryani Path than the Craftworld Aeldari. Often these rogue Asuryani seek the patronage of one of the Exodite tribes. They bring skills the Exodites value highly, and so are always made welcome at the courts of the tribal Aeldari."
 Exodite_ideas_7:0 "Webway Transportation"
 Exodite_ideas_7_desc:0 "The links between the Exodites’ crystal standing stones form a part of the Aeldari Webway. This enables Aeldari to move between the craftworlds and the Exodite Maiden Worlds, with interlinking paths over the Exodite worlds themselves."

 Hiveworld_ideas:0 "Hive World Ideas"
 Hiveworld_ideas_start:0 "Hive World Traditions"
 Hiveworld_ideas_bonus:0 "Hive World Ambition"
 Hiveworld_ideas_1:0 "Empower Planetary Defense Forces"
 Hiveworld_ideas_1_desc:0 "Each major Imperial world maintains Planetary Defense Forces, militias under the control of the local government responsible for maintaining stability as well as continued loyalty to the Imperium. Expanding and standardizing such forces would provide a professional standing army capable of independently defending worlds."
 Hiveworld_ideas_2:0 "Enforce Social Stratification"
 Hiveworld_ideas_2_desc:0 "Hive cities are characterized by a rigid hierarchy in which civilians are rarely able to change their social status. Exploiting such structures would ensure that a hive world operates efficiently."
 Hiveworld_ideas_3:0 "Purge the Underhive Cults"
 Hiveworld_ideas_3_desc:0 "The lowest sections of a hive are inhabited by all manner of cults which prevent the enforcement of law and order. Purging these groups would ensure that the underhives remain unable to mobilize insurrections."
 Hiveworld_ideas_4:0 "Archaeotech Scavenging"
 Hiveworld_ideas_4_desc:0 "The collapsed sections of a hive which have remained untouched for millennia may contain large caches of archeotech, artifacts from the Dark Age of Technology far beyond the knowledge of the contemporary Imperium. Supporting expeditions into such areas would provide the hive world access to such scientific marvels."
 Hiveworld_ideas_5:0 "Court the Noble of the Spires"
 Hiveworld_ideas_5_desc:0 "A hive's spires, the topmost sections of the city, are home to the world's most wealthy and powerful. Courting favor with the noble families which scheme atop the spires would put their skills in intrgue to good use."
 Hiveworld_ideas_6:0 "Support Redemptionist Mutant Hunts"
 Hiveworld_ideas_6_desc:0 "Redemptionists adhere to a more radical interpretration of the Imperial Creed which emphasizes the purging mankind of its impurities. Their movement has become popular in underhives in response to extreme social stratification. Directing their zealotry towards psykers and other mutants would provide stability to the underhives while eliminating potential sources of unrest."
 Hiveworld_ideas_7:0 "Enhance Generatorium Maintenance"
 Hiveworld_ideas_7_desc:0 "Generatoria, also known as plasma reactors, are generators designed by the Adeptus Mechanicus to power the entirety of a hive's operations. Understanding how these complex machines operate and potentially improving their performance would enable hives to operate at a much greater scale."

 Xeno_ideas:0 "Xeno Ideas"
 Xeno_ideas_start:0 "Xeno Traditions"
 Xeno_ideas_bonus:0 "Xeno Ambition"
 Xeno_ideas_1:0 "Xenotechnological Innovation"
 Xeno_ideas_1_desc:0 "Maintaining a long history of minimal contact with other species has allowed xeno civilizations to develop a unique approach to technological development. The exotic nature of xenotechnological weaponry to the galaxy’s primary civilizations prevents them from effectively developing effective countermeasures."
 Xeno_ideas_2:0 "Crisis Coalitions"
 Xeno_ideas_2_desc:0 "Xeno civilizations are prone to maintaining flexible economic arrangements, forming coalitions only when faced with overwhelming shared threats."
 Xeno_ideas_3:0 "Resistance to Chaos"
 Xeno_ideas_3_desc:0 "The majority of alien races in the galaxy do not have the psychic potential of the Elder and mankind. This renders them less susceptible to the influence of chaos."
 Xeno_ideas_4:0 "Renowned Mercenaries"
 Xeno_ideas_4_desc:0 "The unique physiology and weaponry of xeno civilizations render them appealing mercenaries throughout the galaxy."
 Xeno_ideas_5:0 "The Cold Trade"
 Xeno_ideas_5_desc:0 "The unique and often advanced nature of the technology used by xeno civilizations render their inventions highly prized among the Imperium’s nobles and Rogue Traders, with a covert illicit market known as the Cold Trade developing around the trade of xenotech."
 Xeno_ideas_6:0 "Navigator Ties"
 Xeno_ideas_6_desc:0 "Though the Imperium as a whole maintains a genocidal approach towards xeno civilizations, there exist certain segments of Imperial society open to diplomatic exchanges. A particularly invaluable contact has been the Navis Nobilite, with Navigators providing outsiders access to the Imperium’s extensive navigational data"
 Xeno_ideas_7:0 "Galactic Expansion"
 Xeno_ideas_7_desc:0 "The Tyranids hive fleets on the fringes of the galaxy have threatened the homeworlds of many xeno civilizations while the Imperium remains too preoccupied with its consolidation to protect its peripheries. Such conditions warrant territorial expansion into unprotected systems no longer under Imperial protection."

 XDJ_ideas:0 "Blood Angel Ideas"
 XDJ_ideas_start:0 "Blood Angel Traditions"
 XDJ_ideas_bonus:0 "Blood Angel Ambition"
 XDJ_ideas_1:0 "Revenant Legion"
 XDJ_ideas_1_desc:0 "The Blood Angels were known as the Revenant Legion prior to being united with their primarch, Sanguinius. They earned this title by virtue of their reputation for securing victory against seemingly insurmountable circumstances."
 XDJ_ideas_2:0 "Sanguinius' Rage"
 XDJ_ideas_2_desc:0 "While Blood Angel primarch Sanguinius was renowned for his nobility, such virtues were marred by periodic bouts of rage. The psychic imprint of the primarch’s death at the end of the Horus Heresy has since imprinted such tendencies, now known as the Black Rage, to the Blood Angels as a whole."
 XDJ_ideas_3:0 "Prolonged Lifespans"
 XDJ_ideas_3_desc:0 "The Blood Angels are long-lived, even among space marines with lifespans numbering in the hundreds. The Blood Angels’ Chapter Master, Dante, holds the title of longest-lived space marine and occupied the position for over a millenia."
 XDJ_ideas_4:0 "Imperial Shock Troops"
 XDJ_ideas_4_desc:0 "The Blood Angels were almost peerless in their rapid pacification of worlds, rivaled only by the World Eaters. Their fiery temperment made them ideal shock troops in the Emperor's campaigns of conquest."
 XDJ_ideas_5:0 "The Sanguinor"
 XDJ_ideas_5_desc:0 "The Blood Angels are watched over by the Sanguinor, a mysterious entity which appears during their times of greatest need. Whether the Sanguinor is a member of the Blood Angels' Sanguinary Guard empowered by the will of the Emperor or a purely psychic construct as theorized by the Inquisition, it remains certain that the Sanguinor exemplifies the nobility of Sanguinius."
 XDJ_ideas_6:0 "Artistic Pursuits"
 XDJ_ideas_6_desc:0 "While previously known for their barbarism and savagery, the Blood Angels have since become renowned scholars and artists under the direction of Sanguinius. Such refined pursuits provide them with purpose beyond their role as instruments of war."
 XDJ_ideas_7:0 "Legacy of the Silent King"
 XDJ_ideas_7_desc:0 "Though the Blood Angels once fought with the the Necrons' Silent King, Szarekh, an invasion by the Tyranids prompted an alliance of convenience to annihilate the shared threat. Though the Blood Angels could have attacked the weakened Necrons, their sense of honor prevailed."

 XYG_ideas:0 "Thousand Sons Ideas"
 XYG_ideas_start:0 "Thousand Sons Traditions"
 XYG_ideas_bonus:0 "Thousand Sons Ambition"
 XYG_ideas_1:0 "Rubric of Ahriman"
 XYG_ideas_1_desc:0 "The majority of the Thousand Sons have been reduced to Rubricae, unthinking automata spawned from a flawed ritual intended to cure the rampant mutations that had long plagued the legion. Despite such consequences, those who survived the Rubric of Ahriman were granted unprecedented power and wield the Rubricae as instruments for their own ends."
 XYG_ideas_2:0 "Splendor of Tizca"
 XYG_ideas_2_desc:0 "The city of Tizca was once known for its beauty. Though the city’s majestic spires have been replaced with disfigured obelisks and mighty pyramids given way to crystalline earth-matter, a glimmer of its former splendor remains."
 XYG_ideas_3:0 "Libraries of the Arcane"
 XYG_ideas_3_desc:0 "The realm of Magnus has always been one of unrestricted learning and scholarship. The Great Library of Tizca and various other pyramid complexes on Sortiarius contain much of the Thousand Sons’ collective knowledge."
 XYG_ideas_4:0 "Psychic Planetary Defenses"
 XYG_ideas_4_desc:0 "The Thousands Sons do nott rely on conventional planetary defenses. Powerful illusions and psychic barriers defend its worlds from orbital bombardment. Such precautions have allowed the realm of Magnus to grow despite its proximity to Imperial space."
 XYG_ideas_5:0 "Psyker Haven"
 XYG_ideas_5_desc:0 "Psykers have faced persecution across the Imperium for millenia. Those who aren’t killed immediately are sacrificed daily in the hundreds to sustain the Emperor, rarely getting the opportunity to reach their true psychic potential. Magnus values the most powerful of these psykers, calling them to Sortiarius and inviting them to seek knowledge within its libraries. The weakest are sacrificed to accelerate humanity’s psychic evolution."
 XYG_ideas_6:0 "Corrupted Manufactora"
 XYG_ideas_6_desc:0 "The realm of Magnus maintains substantial ties to the Dark Mechanicum, enabling the convergence of psychic and industrial power. This ensures the many Rubricae of the Thousand Sons are fully armed."
 XYG_ideas_7:0 "Tower of the Cyclops"
 XYG_ideas_7_desc:0 "Dwarfing all other towers on Sortiarius is Magnus’ own Tower of the Cyclops. Its great glowing eye penetrates through the Warp and places the entire galaxy under the watchful gaze of the Red Cyclops. If a promising psyker or arcane artifact attracts the primarch’s interest, a raid from the Thousand Sons is sure to follow."

 XGF_ideas:0 "T'au Ideas"
 XGF_ideas_start:0 "T'au Traditions"
 XGF_ideas_bonus:0 "T'au Ambition"
 XGF_ideas_1:0 "T'au Caste System"
 XGF_ideas_1_desc:0 "T'au society is divided into a number of castes, each responsible for managing a specific aspect of their civilisation. The T'au's central motivating ideal is that everyone in their empire, regardless of their species or culture of origin, will work for the collective betterment of everyone else, an almost mystical philosophy that is embodied in the Greater Good."
 XGF_ideas_2:0 "Rapid Technological Development"
 XGF_ideas_2_desc:0 "T’au civilization is characterized by its rapid technological advancement, spurred by its collaboration with other xeno civilizations and absence of taboos surrounding research. The T’au are also capable of reverse-engineering advanced xeno technology, achieving faster-than-light travel through the AL-38 Slipstream Module by modifying Imperial and Kroot ships."
 XGF_ideas_3:0 "Psychic Resistance"
 XGF_ideas_3_desc:0 "The T’au possess faint soul signatures which prevent them from developing psychic powers. This nonetheless protects them from the predation of chaos which have long plagued the societies of the Eldar and Imperium."
 XGF_ideas_4:0 "Mont'Ka and Kauyon"
 XGF_ideas_4_desc:0 "The T’au’s considerable range of vision in the electromagnetic spectrum and a predilection for patience have led to a preference for long-range combat and predetermined engagements. This doctrine is exemplified through their strategies of Mon’Ka and Kauyon, respectively translating to “killing blow” and “patient hunter” in the T’au language. The former refers to a carefully planned attack designed to wipe out critical enemy forces in a single well-placed strike, while the latter entails luring adversaries into carefully prepared killing zones for an ambush."
 XGF_ideas_5:0 "Fifth Sphere of Expansion"
 XGF_ideas_5_desc:0 "The T’au Empire organizes its territorial enlargement into distinct Spheres of Expansion. While the previous Fourth Sphere of Expansion faced complications due to non-T'au auxiliaries disrupting the empire’s attempts at Warp-based travel, the Fifth Sphere shall decisively integrate the Chalnath Expanse."
 XGF_ideas_6:0 "Ethereal Compulsion"
 XGF_ideas_6_desc:0 "Members of the T’au’s leading caste, the Ethereals, are able to compel other castes and species to focus on the Greater Good. The nature of this ability remains mysterious, but may be the result of pheromone or psychic-based influence  related to a diamond-shaped bony ridge unique to Ethereal physiology."
 XGF_ideas_7:0 "Gue'vesa Defectors"
 XGF_ideas_7_desc:0 "The T’au Empire contains a growing population of Gue’vesa, former humans of the Imperium of Man. While a considerable number of these humans are captured military personnel, many Imperial worlds are enticed by the ideological appeal of the Greater Good and willingly join the empire."


 Necron_ideas:0 "Necron Ideas"
 Necron_ideas_start:0 "Necron Traditions"
 Necron_ideas_bonus:0 "Necron Ambition"
 Necron_ideas_1:0 "Ancestral Claims"
 Necron_ideas_1_desc:0 "Though the Necron lords rule from crownworlds few in number, their former domains once stretched across the vast borders of the former Infinite Empire. Though many of their former worlds are now inhabited, they shall be expelled one way or another."
 Necron_ideas_2:0 "Gauss Technology"
 Necron_ideas_2_desc:0 "Ceramide. Adamantium. Wraithbone. The fledgling civilizations of the galaxy still rely on digging these minerals from the ground and fashioning them into primitive armor. None are capable of resisting the Necrons’ gauss weaponry, capable of reducing matter to atoms. Combustion and directed energy weapons are not satisfactory for the Necrons, who seek nothing short of total obliteration for their opponents."
 Necron_ideas_3:0 "Slumbering Tombs"
 Necron_ideas_3_desc:0 "The bygone Infinite Empire of the Necrons once ruled much of the galaxy following their victory over the Old Ones. Though the number of active Necrons may be few, there exist plentiful worlds with slumbering tomb complexes waiting to be awakened."
 Necron_ideas_4:0 "Deathmarks"
 Necron_ideas_4_desc:0 "The Deathmarks are the Necrons’ most skilled assassins and snipers. Wielding their civilization’s most advanced spatial manipulation technology, Deathmarks travel and strike their targets via pocket dimensions. Once marked, their target would be lucky to survive more than a few seconds before being torn apart by a synaptic disintegrator."
 Necron_ideas_5:0 "Dynastic Rivalries"
 Necron_ideas_5_desc:0 "The Necrons have changed much from their previous biological existence as the sickly, short-lived warriors of the Necrontyr. One thing that has nonetheless remained immutable is the civilization’s pride and loyalty to clan ties. The passage of aeons have done little to dull the plentiful rivalries between the various Necron house. Millenia of technological advancement have only made the pursuit of such blood feuds all the more ruthless and efficient."
 Necron_ideas_6:0 "Intertialess Drive"
 Necron_ideas_6_desc:0 "While the spawn of the Old Ones rely on unreliableand rigid methods of travel via the Warp or Webway, the Necrons have had millenia to perfect the intertialess drive. This method of faster-than-light travel takes place entirely in realspace, allowing Necron fleets to not only travel large distances but also make short-range jumps across battlefields in bursts of relativistic energy."
 Necron_ideas_7:0 "Blackstone Mastery"
 Necron_ideas_7_desc:0 "The formation of the Great Rift has led to the galaxy’s younger civilizations to begin their rudimentary experimentations with blackstone. While they try in vain to tamper with forces they don’t understand, they haven’t remotely begun to reach the level of mastery the Necrons wield over the substance. Countless Necron megastructures of unrivaled complexity may be found across the galaxy, protecting its fledgling races from threats they are unable of perceiving. Blackstone was the foundation of the Infinite Empire’s marvels, and it shall be the tool the Necrons use to once more assert their rule."

 Astartes_ideas:0 "Astartes Ideas"
 Astartes_ideas_start:0 "Astartes Traditions"
 Astartes_ideas_bonus:0 "Astartes Ambition"
 Astartes_ideas_1:0 "Codex Astartes"
 Astartes_ideas_1_desc:0 "Long divided by disparities in doctrines and modus operandi, space marines have since operated under standardized procedures in accordance with the Codex Astartes. Written by primarch Roboute Guilliman to pass down the wisdom of space marines past, the treatise contains everything from unit markings to planetary assault procedures."
 Astartes_ideas_2:0 "Emphasize Successor Chapter Ties"
 Astartes_ideas_2_desc:0 "The Codex Astartes divided the nine loyalist space marine legions, previously numbering in the tens of thousands, into individual successor chapters of limited size. This has not prevented the shared heritage which binds successor chapters from sustaining amicable fraternal ties."
 Astartes_ideas_3:0 "Primaris Reinforcements"
 Astartes_ideas_3_desc:0 "The creation of Primaris marines has enabled space marine chapters to reach unprecedented rates of growth. There initially existed backlash towards these reinforcements, with many Firstborn astartes being wary of their chapter’s cultures being supplanted by outsiders. Necessity and the ever-present threat of retaliation from the Adeptus Custodes have nonetheless led to the gradual integration of these reinforcements. Many Firstborn have since crossed the Rubicon Primaris to benefit from the upgrades of their newer peers as well."
 Astartes_ideas_4:0 "Expand Chapter Serfdom"
 Astartes_ideas_4_desc:0 "The Astartes are too few in number and too essential in the Imperium’s conduct of war that the maintenance of their infrastructure and weaponry has been delegated to chapter serfs, servants indentured to their space marine chapters. They may be drawn from eligible aspirants or the children born from preexisting serfs."
 Astartes_ideas_5:0 "Reclusiam Relics"
 Astartes_ideas_5_desc:0 "The Astartes’ fortress-monasteries each contain a Reclusiam, a chamber dedicated to holding relics of importance to its space marine chapter. The spiritual head of a chapter, the Master of Sanctity, integrates these relics into their chapter’s unique traditions and beliefs."
 Astartes_ideas_6:0 "Cooperation with Fleet-Based Chapters"
 Astartes_ideas_6_desc:0 "Many space marine chapters do not operate from a homeworld, instead maintaining a large fleet with a mobile fortress-monastery. While some chapters become fleet-based following the destruction of a former homeworld or its forfeiture as penance for treason, others have been fleet-based since their creation. These chapters often lack access to new recruits, enabling opportunities for collaboration with chapters maintaining established homeworlds."
 Astartes_ideas_7:0 "Maintain Forge World Supply Lines"
 Astartes_ideas_7_desc:0 "Safeguarding communications and supply lines with the Adeptus Mechanicus is essential to the functioning of any space marine chapter. Astartes remain reliant on Forge Worlds to sustain their supply of weaponry, ammunition, power armor, vehicles and starships. It is the Adeptus Mechanicus’ genetors which study a chapter homeworld’s native population for potential mutations which may impact its quality of aspirants."

 Genestealer_ideas_2:0 "Space Hulk Infiltration"
 Genestealer_ideas_2_desc:0 "Genestealers are able to rapidly infest new planets by infiltrating voidships and large, spacefaring collections of ship debris known as space hulks. The mass displacement caused by the formation of the Great Rift has further accelerated the Genestealers’ proliferation."
 Genestealer_ideas_3:0 "Brood Intelligence"
 Genestealer_ideas_3_desc:0 "Communication between genestealers takes place telepathically through a Broodmind, reflecting a weaker version of the gestalt consciousness of the Tyranids themselves. This enables cultists to act as a cohesive unit despite their remaining individuality."
 Genestealer_ideas_4:0 "High Society Ties"
 Genestealer_ideas_4_desc:0 "Genestealer cults are able to operate with impunity by building large networks of loyalty among a planet's governors and aristocracy."
 Genestealer_ideas_5:0 "Interspecies Infection"
 Genestealer_ideas_5_desc:0 "Though humans remain ideal candidates for Genestealer infection due to the significant population density of hive worlds, genestealers cults may take root among almost any spacefaring civilizations. Feral Orks are also viable for infection, as are the Tau, Eldar, Kroot, Vespid, and Hrud. Genestealers are also capable of infecting and mutating animals when no suitable sapient species are available, though the resulting mutations render them unsuitable for reabsorption into the Tyranid Hive Mind."
 Genestealer_ideas_6:0 "Covert Operations"
 Genestealer_ideas_6_desc:0 "Genestealer Cults develop comprehensive intelligence networks used to sabotage military assets and subvert planetary governments. Such operations are used to weaken a world’s defenses in preparation for the arrival of the Tyranid hive mind."
 Genestealer_ideas_7:0 "Military Infiltration"
 Genestealer_ideas_7_desc:0 "The more powerful and ambitious of Genestealer Cults are able to directly infiltrate Astra Militarum regiments to stockpile ammunition and access a greater pool of recruits. The frequency of abhumans such as Ogryns and Ratlins in the Imperium's military forces allows Hybrids to operate openly."

 Iron_Warriors_ideas_1_desc:0 "The Iron Warriors value the efficiency of cybernetic augmentations, much like their loyalist counterparts in the Adeptus Mechanicus and Iron Hands successor chapters. Their proximity to Chaos has further proliferated such norms by forcing space marines to cut off mutating appendages."
 Iron_Warriors_ideas_2:0 "Sappers of the Emperor"
 Iron_Warriors_ideas_2_desc:0 "The Iron Warriors specialized in sieges during the Imperium’s Great Crusades, excelling in the complete destruction of static defenses. This role led to a rivalry with the fort-building Imperial Fists legion, a relationship which facilitated their turn to Chaos."
 Iron_Warriors_ideas_3:0 "Legacy of the Iron Cage"
 Iron_Warriors_ideas_3_desc:0 "Despite their responsibilities pertaining to siegecraft under the Imperium, the Iron Warriors’ military acumen rendered them masterful defensive strategists almost equal their Imperial Fist rivals. This potential was exemplified during the Iron Cage Incident, during which the Imperial Fists were drawn into an ambush on the planet of Sebastus IV which almost annihilated the legion alongside their primarch, Rogal Dorn."
 Iron_Warriors_ideas_4:0 "The Corpse Grinders"
 Iron_Warriors_ideas_4_desc:0 "The Iron Warriors’ are famed for their methodical application of overwhelming force. When attrition alone could not win a siege, Perturabo’s sons applied their exceptional skill in close-quarters combat in a storming of a breach. The lack of a surrender grew to became preferable, as it vindicated the Iron Warriors’ complete decimation of defending armies."
 Iron_Warriors_ideas_5:0 "New Mechanicum Ties"

 Iron_Warriors_ideas_6:0 "The Siege of Terra"
 Iron_Warriors_ideas_6_desc:0 "The Iron Warriors were the most invaluable traitor legion during their siege of the Imperium’s throneworld, Terra. Though eventually marginalized by Horus in preference of more expedient plans of attack, the Iron strategies of Iron Warriors’ primarch Perturabo saw significant yet incremental success in breaking down the defenses of the Imperial Palace. "
 Iron_Warriors_ideas_7:0 "Geneseed Raids"
 Iron_Warriors_ideas_7_desc:0 "The Iron Warriors are particularly aggressive in their attempts to bolster the meager manpower issues experienced by space marines tainted by Chaos.

 Raven_Guard_ideas_2:0 "Sable Brand"
 Raven_Guard_ideas_2_desc:0 "The gene-seed of Primarch Corvus Corax is subject to a flaw known as the Sable Brand, instilling them with a cold-blooded determination to fight with no regard for self-preservation. Those who experience the Sable Brand were originally organized into units known as the Shadow Killers, though the manpower issues of the Raven Guard since their near-decimation after the Isstvan V Drop Site Massacre have led to limitations on their use. Efforts from apothecaries to cure the gene-flaw are carried out in complete secrecy."
 Raven_Guard_ideas_3:0 "Trifold Path of Shadow"
 Raven_Guard_ideas_3_desc:0 "The Raven Guard's tactics are based on the Trifold Path of Shadow developed by Primarch Corvus Corax. The teachings consist of three aspects, Ambush, Stealth, and Vigilance. Mastering one Path, taught Corax, brought the possibility of victory; mastery of two rendered triumph likely, and accomplishment in all three made the foe’s defeat all but inevitable."
 Raven_Guard_ideas_4:0 "Breakers of Chains"
 Raven_Guard_ideas_4_desc:0 "The moon of Deliverance, former home of Corvus Corax, was once enslaved by the Tech Guilds of the planet Kiavahr. It was through an insurgency waged by the primarch that the people of Deliverance were freed from their chains. Liberation has since become central to the identity of the Raven Guard."
 Raven_Guard_ideas_5:0 "Guerilla Tactics"
 Raven_Guard_ideas_5_desc:0 "The Raven Guard's preference for asymmetric warfare has led to a heavy emphasis on guerilla tactics. Squads of land speeders and gunships are used to overcome opponents with superior mobility and tactical autonomy."
 Raven_Guard_ideas_6:0 "Masters of Sabotage"
 Raven_Guard_ideas_6_desc:0 "Though more associated with waging insurgencies than the covert operations conducted by the Alpha Legion, the Raven Guard are also well-versed in the arts of sabotage and assassination.

Aspirants are transported to the wilderness with no clothing or supplies, expected to find their way back to the Fang without assistance. Implanted with the Canis Helix, those undertaking the test must also resist their animalistic instincts which may turn them into feral man-wolf hybrids known as the Wulfen."
 Space_Wolves_ideas_2:0 "Return of the Lost Company"
 Space_Wolves_ideas_2_desc:0 "The lost Great Company of the Corpse Renders, previously thought to be lost during the Horus Heresy, have recently emerged from the Eye of Terror. The Company holds great respect among the Space Wolves, formed from the original followers of Leman Russ. Though many of them have succumbed to the Wulfen Curse, their reintegration with the Space Wolves has given many hope that the return of Lemun Russ is imminent."
 Space_Wolves_ideas_3:0 "Defiance of the Codex"
 Space_Wolves_ideas_3_desc:0 "The Space Wolves are the most defiant among space marines in their rejection of the Codex Astartes. Attempts by the Adeptus Ministorum and Inquisition to force compliance have ended in military retaliation from the sons of Russ. The structure and norms of their successor chapters are instead founded upon Fenrisian culture, divided into twelve Great Companies larger than many Codex-compliant chapters."
 Space_Wolves_ideas_4:0 "Cautious Primaris Integration"
 Space_Wolves_ideas_4_desc:0 "Primaris marines initially faced much opposition from the Wolf Lords, who suspected them of not being true to the ways of Fenris and Leman Russ. Their willingness to undergo the Test of Morkai and increasing number of Firstborn space marines undergoing the Rubicon Primaris themselves, however, has resolved such concerns and mitigated the Space Wolves' long-standing manpower issues."
 Space_Wolves_ideas_5:0 "Rune Priests"
 Space_Wolves_ideas_5_desc:0 "The Space Wolves do not maintain traditional Librarians used in other space marine chapters, instead relying on Rune Priests for psychic combat roles and lorekeeping. Instead of drawing power from the Warp, Rune Priests are instead channel the animal spirits of Fenris through runes. This spared them from the Emperor's ban on space marine psykers following the Council of Nikaea while continuing to protect them from manipulation by Chaos."
 Space_Wolves_ideas_6:0 "Executioners of the Emperor"
 Space_Wolves_ideas_6_desc:0 "The Space Wolves were not born to govern like the Ultramarines nor build like the Iron Hands.

 Space_Wolves_ideas_7:0 "The Great Hunt"
 Space_Wolves_ideas_7_desc:0 "The Space Wolves continue to search for their missing Primarch, Leman Russ, in grand expeditions known as Great Hunts. Visions of Russ appear before the Great Wolf in visions, announcing the time for a new Hunt. All twelve Great Companies take to the stars in separate directions, giving rise to countless new tales of heroic adventures and noble deeds which shall be recounted by the Rune Priests."

 Iron_Hands_ideas_1_desc:0 "The death of Primarch Ferrus Manus during the Horus Heresy left the Iron Hands searching for new avenues of strength to prevent such tragedies in the future. This pursuit led to their affinity with technology growing more radical, ritualistically replacing body parts with bionics in what is known as the Blessing of Iron. "
 Iron_Hands_ideas_2:0 "Mechanicus Ties"
 Iron_Hands_ideas_2_desc:0 "The Iron Hands, fighting pitched battles which often required advanced engines of war, have developed long-standing ties with the Adeptus Mechanicus to secure the necessary supplies. Such a connection is reinforced by a shared consensus on the weakness of flesh and appreciation for cybernetic augmentation."
 Iron_Hands_ideas_3:0 "Inter-Clan Warfare"
 Iron_Hands_ideas_3_desc:0 "The Iron Hands have done little to end inter-clan warfare on their homeworld of Medusa, instead preferring to use it as a tool to weed out weak potential recruits and strengthen the worthy."
 Iron_Hands_ideas_4:0 "Forgechains"
 Iron_Hands_ideas_4_desc:0 "Augmented vertebrae known as Forgechains are used by members of the Iron hands to indicate affiliation, with each vertebrae representing acceptance with a certain Clan Company of Medusa. The augmentation is viewed as symbolic of the ties that bind the Iron Hands together."
 Iron_Hands_ideas_5:0 "Calculus of Battle"
 Iron_Hands_ideas_5_desc:0 "The logical approach of the Iron Hands to warfare is exemplified by a set of hexamathic formulae known as the Calculus of Battle. These procedures break down military conflicts as raw data where enemy actions can be predicted and balanced like an equation. The Calculus does not account for civilian casualties and may entail the cold sacrifice of individual space marine squads to achieve victory, reflecting the cold, calculating outlook of the Iron Tenth2."
 Iron_Hands_ideas_6:0 "Calculum Rationale"
 Iron_Hands_ideas_6_desc:0 "The Calculum Rationale is a process of caluclation by which the Iron Hands decide how many resources would be required to prevail in a prospective military engagement. The sons of Ferrus Manus will often refuse to participate in conflicts when the calculation indicates that they have insufficient resources to do so."
 Iron_Hands_ideas_7:0 "The Iron Council"
 Iron_Hands_ideas_7_desc:0 "The Iron Hands are unique in their lack of a single Chapter Master or an equivalent position, with authority instead being divided between the Iron Council.

The Salamanders have since developed a substance capable of generating pulses of heat detectable by fire-sight. This enables them to not only have a means of communicating via tactical markings visible only to them but also a way of rapidly identifying one another on the battlefield."
 Salamanders_ideas_2:0 "Compassion of Vulkan"
 Salamanders_ideas_2_desc:0 "Unlike many other space marines who see themselves as separate or superior to the human race, the Salamanders understand their role as protectors of mankind.

 Salamanders_ideas_3:0 "Environmental Hazard Resistance"
 Salamanders_ideas_3_desc:0 "The Salamanders benefit from a degree of constitution that far exceeds the average space marine. This is exemplified through their exceptional resistance to extreme temperatures, poisons, and radiation."
 Salamanders_ideas_4:0 "Blacksmith Training"
 Salamanders_ideas_4_desc:0 "The art of forging is integral to Salamander culture. Initiates begin as forge workers before being fully inducted while space marines themselves are fully capable of maintaining their own equipment. This leaves the most skilled of Salamander artificers free to utilize their skills in metallurgy towards greaters ends, such as the creation of personalized Artificer Armor."
 Salamanders_ideas_5:0 "Flame Weaponry"
 Salamanders_ideas_5_desc:0 "The Salamanders are known for their proclivity towards flame weapons. Combined with mass deployments of armored forces, this allows the sons of Vulkan to methodically advance on the battlefield to exterminate opposing armies."

 Salamanders_ideas_7:0 "Search for Vulkan's Artifacts"
 Salamanders_ideas_7_desc:0 "Primarch Vulkan of the Salamanders crafted nine artifacts to aid his legion, leaving behind a collection of writings known as the Tome of Fire to provide hints to their locations. Five of these artifacts have been discovered since the primarch's disappearance.

 Dark_Angels_ideas_1_desc:0 "The Dark Angels, while maintaining their commitments to the Imperium, remain singularly focused on hunting down the Fallen. Led by Primarch Lion El’Jonson’s former mentor and father, the Fallen are Dark Angels who fell to Chaos and seized control of the legion’s homeworld of Caliban during the Horus Heresy. Though the planet was eventually scoured and Luther captured, his followers were scattered in the Warp and continue to be hunted down by the Dark Angels’ successor chapters as penance."
 Dark_Angels_ideas_2:0 "Legacy of the Order"
 Dark_Angels_ideas_2_desc:0 "The foundation of the Dark Angels is built upon the Order, an honorable band of knights from the world of Caliban responsible for hunting down the world’s hostile fauna. Following its induction of Primarch Lion El’Jonson, the Order united the planet’s knights and exterminated the Great Beasts of Caliban."
 Dark_Angels_ideas_3:0 "Secrets of the Inner Circle"
 Dark_Angels_ideas_3_desc:0 "The Dark Angels operate under multiple levels of secrecy that allow members to gradually learn more about the former legion’s origins as they rise through the ranks. Complete knowledge of the Fallen’s betrayal, however, is known only to the chapter’s Inner Circle. Such secrecy is essential to keeping their narrowly avoided fall to Chaos away from the Imperium, a transgression which the Dark Angels believe would lead to their destruction."
 Dark_Angels_ideas_4:0 "Unity Among the Unforgiven"
 Dark_Angels_ideas_4_desc:0 "Though the remaining space marine legions of the Imperium have been fragmented following the Horus Heresy, the successor chapters of the Dark Angels remain united in their hunt for the Fallen. This persisting collaboration has allowed them to rapidly mobilize against a shared threat when necessary."
 Dark_Angels_ideas_5:0 "Primordial Strain"
 Dark_Angels_ideas_5_desc:0 "The first prototype space marines were made with the highly stable Gene-seed of Dark Angel primarch, Lion E’Jonson. Though almost none created with the Primordial Strain survived, their culture would continue to influence the Dark Angels following the creation of the space marine legions."
 Dark_Angels_ideas_6:0 "Strategic Independence"
 Dark_Angels_ideas_6_desc:0 "The Dark Angels car little for unified space marine command councils, instead maintaining their own strategic counsel and supply lines. This ensures not only their continued secrecy but also a degree of strategic independence that enables the sons of the Lion to exercise their tactical acumen unhindered."
 Dark_Angels_ideas_7:0 "Emperor's Angels of Death"
 Dark_Angels_ideas_7_desc:0 "The first of the space marine legions, the Dark Angels were entrusted with the responsibility of safeguarding the Sol system while the others were still mustering their numbers.

 Kin_ideas_1_desc:0 "The Kin emphasize survival, borne out of necessity from their origins aboard void-borne mining fleets. Laziness and waste became reviled, with even minor lapses in vigilance resulting in insufficient supplies or repairs which could potentially endanger an entire fleet. Such concerns eventually evolved into an acquisitiveness which has led other civilizations to judge them as hoarders."
 Kin_ideas_2:0 "Wisdom of the Ancestor Cores"
 Kin_ideas_2_desc:0 "The Votann Ancestor Cores are ancient super-cogitators containing gestalt repositories of wisdom and knowledge. Originally used by early Kin mining fleets for practical mission advice, they have gradually developed a cultural significance among the Leagues of Votann. The memories of the countless generations of dead Kin being uploaded into the machines have led to their advice growing more cryptic over time."
 Kin_ideas_3:0 "Cloneskeins"
 Kin_ideas_3_desc:0 "All Kin are produced as clones, with their genetic structure being underpinned by a standardized set of mutations known as Cloneskeins. While the genetic pools of these templates are varied, they all grant the Kin traits necessary to survive near the Galactic Core such as a denser physiology, infrared vision, and a resilience to extreme environments."
 Kin_ideas_4:0 "Particle Excavators"
 Kin_ideas_4_desc:0 "The Kin are able to thrive in the Galactic Core by employing Particle Excavators to produce fusion energy from harvested newborn stars. Though the region of space remains holds many dangers, particularly the dead zone that encircles the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy, the Leagues of Votann have effectively harnessed its riches."
 Kin_ideas_5:0 "Guild Loyalties"

They serve multiple functions for the Leagues, ranging from mining to combat pilots, though they largely lack the ambition to pursue leadership roles."
 Kin_ideas_7:0 "Prospect Fleets"
 Kin_ideas_7_desc:0 "Prospects are the expeditionary fleets of the Kin, venturing out of the Galactic Core to seek wealth for their League and knowledge for their Votann Ancestor Vore.

 XGK_ideas_2:0 "Sustainable Industrialism"
 XGK_ideas_2_desc:0 "The worlds of Ultramar are unlike the majority of the Imperium’s centers of industry, hives, forge worlds, and manufactory planets rendered barely habitable by industrial waste.

 XGK_ideas_5:0 "Stable Gene-Seed"
 XGK_ideas_5_desc:0 "The Ultramarines benefit from a highly stable genes-seed, with only a ten percent probability of mutation.

Guilliman's gene-seed has, however, been noted to influence the Ultramarines' predisposition towards conformity."
 XGK_ideas_6:0 "Tactical Diversity"
 XGK_ideas_6_desc:0 "The military doctrine of the Ultramarines favors tactical diversity and the application of overwhelming force.

 XGK_ideas_7:0 "First Among the Chapters"

 Chaos_ideas_7:0 "Mutations"
 Chaos_ideas_7_desc:0 "Much like the space marines which have fought against the Imperium since the days of the Horus Heresy, members of Chaos cults are granted powers due to their proximity to the Warp.

These genestealer cults rapidly expand and ensure minimal disruption for a subsequent direct invasion."
 Tyranid_ideas_5:0 "Capillary Towers"
 Tyranid_ideas_5_desc:0 "After major resistance to an invasion has been overcome, the Tyranids are able to terraform conquered planets and begin the absorption of genetic material through the use of capillary towers. This enables the hive mind to gather biomass rapidly and efficiently."

They would eventually prove their mettle after eliminating an Attack Moon approaching Terra."
 Deathwatch_ideas_5:0 "Furor Tactics"
 Deathwatch_ideas_5_desc:0 "The Deathwatch frequently employ Furor Tactics, entailing the delivery of explosive firepower across a wide frontage. By concentrating on tightly-packed hordes of their foes, corpses of the enemy slow the advances of those behind.

His descent into the Dark Prince's influence began on the conquest of Laer and culminated in his full embrace of Chaos at the fateful Battle of Isstvan V, where he slew his former brother-in-arms, Ferrus Manus.

Yet perhaps his most defining moment was the Battle of Thessala, where he slashed Roboute Guilliman’s throat with the aid of his generals. Unfortunately, Guilliman was revived in Ultramar not long ago. Fulgrim, however, sees no threat in this resurrection, even warning him on the day he returned. It seems Guilliman’s throat might be due for another reminder."

Fortunately we still have a few of the Dolmen Gates, the living stone portals that allows us to penetrate into a select portion of the Webway. With them now under our domain, we are able to achieve faster-than-light interstellar space travel, with noticeable effects on all areas of governance."

 XTE_ideas_3:0 "Slayers of Gods"
 XTE_ideas_3_desc:0 "Many species in this wretched galaxy consider themselves gods. The arrogant humans have deified a crippled Emperor, while the Drukhari have elevated Asdrubael Vect to apotheosis. Yet, they forget that among these false gods walks a true God-Slayer. It was Szarekh who defeated the C'tan and liberated the Necrons from their servitude, albeit at a very heavy price."

 XTE_ideas_5:0 "The Silent King"
 XTE_ideas_5_desc:0 "The Silent King of days gone bye commanded the Necrontyr with absolute authority. It was he who led them into the war that reshaped their very existence, binding his people to a fate neither living nor dead. Yet, when the cost of victory became clear, he made the ultimate sacrifice, shattering the unity and covenant that tied him to his subjects, and vanished into exile. For millennia, he drifted in the endless void, and the galaxy grew weak in his absence, and now, he has returned to reclaim what was always his."
 XTE_ideas_6:0 "Unified Necron Dynasties"
 XTE_ideas_6_desc:0 "The Silent King stands victorious; having united the fragmented dynasties into a formidable force, one that now commands ample respect across the galaxy. As his influence continues to expand, the very fabric of the galaxy trembles, for the Silent King is no mere ruler, but an outstanding symbol of a new era, one where the Necron ascendancy is absolute across the wider cosmos."

 XPB_ideas_1_desc:0 "In the shadows of the Dark City, a mere slave rose against insurmountable odds, climbing his way, through sheer diplomatic masterwork, to the apex of the Kabalite society. The rise of Asdrubael Vect is a testament to a prodigious ambition unbound by chains, as Vect's cunning reshaped the very fabric of power structure of the entire Webway. His tale of a meteoric rise against all odds is forever etched into the annals of Commorragh's history, serving as a powerful, and potentially dangerous example for others to follow."
 XPB_ideas_2:0 "Master of Puppets"
 XPB_ideas_2_desc:0 "Asdrubael navigates the diplomatic contours of Commorragh as a true puppeter, knitting a complex tapestry of manipulation throughout the Kabalite. He incites rivalry among the various Kabals, turning their ambitions against one another rather than challenging his authority. Vect's unparalleled cunning ensures that their conflicts serve his interests, allowing him to maintain control while they vie for dominance, forever dancing to the rhythm of his grand design."
 XPB_ideas_3:0 "Relentless Onslaugth"
 XPB_ideas_3_desc:0 "The Supreme Overlord embodies the Drukhari tradition of raiding, leading an unyielding and continuous onslaught into the heart of Realspace. Commanding his Kabalite subjects with the promise of untold riches beyond the portals, each raid becomes a meticulously orchestrated display of military might, striking terror into the hearts of entire systems. As the galaxy trembles under the weight of its internecine conflicts, Vect's forces catch their enemies off guard, returning with scores of captives to toil endlessly in the Dark City."

In the sinister Dark City, only the truly cruel can claim the intoxicating rewards of success."

 XPB_ideas_6_desc:0 "The Webway is an ever-shifting labyrinth, a realm of hidden paths and dead-ends.  Those who unlock its secrets become phantoms of war, striking with impunity, bypassing defenses as if they were mere illusions, and vanishing before the enemy can so much as sound the alarm."
 XPB_ideas_7:0 "The Rise of Evil"
 XPB_ideas_7_desc:0 "With our grip on the region solidified, it is time to look beyond the fixed borders of the empire. Plundering raids must evolve into full-scale campaigns of conquest. Our enemies are many, and more are sure to rise, but greatness cannot be achieved in stillnes, its time to act. The Drukhari have lingered in the shadows of the Webway for too long, we will pour through the portals to remind the galaxy of its past conquerors, and its future overlords."

Yet, within the Kabal's embrace lies the promise of strength in numbers and the potential of taking part in the frecuent realspace raids."
Kabal_ideas_2:0 "Dead Man's Chest"
Kabal_ideas_2_desc:0 "The Kabals raid not just in gold, but in flesh and suffering. The spoils of their raids are dragged screaming into the depths of Commorragh, where their torment fuels the eternal hunger of their masters. Every soul taken is another step toward immortality, another measure of power in a world where cruelty is the only currency that matters."
Kabal_ideas_3:0 "Ghosts in the Machine"
Kabal_ideas_3_desc:0 "We navigate quick, agile vessels that dart through the stars like ghosts. Each ship is crafted for speed, allowing them to strike suddenly and vanish before their enemies can react.

Kabal_ideas_4:0 "Cycle of Hatred"
Kabal_ideas_4_desc:0 "A lifetime of raiding hones reflexes sharper than any blade. The Kabals strike without warning and vanish just as quickly, their warriors hardened by the endless cycle of hatred that fuels their plundering. To us, invasion is an art, striking like phantoms, seizing the enemy's assets in the blink of an eye, and vanishing into the void before the victim can even comprehend the full extent of their doom."
Kabal_ideas_5:0 "Vicious Meritocracy"
Kabal_ideas_5_desc:0 "Only the strongest and most cunning can ascend the ranks of the Kabals. Here, status is not inherited; it is earned through bloodshed, betrayal and cunning. Every challenge faced, every rival eliminated, serves to bolster one’s reputation and position. The relentless pursuit of power fosters an environment where only the bold and cruel thrive, as ambition fuels a cycle of violence that propels the most ruthless to greatness. In this bloody meritocracy, glory is forged in the crucible of combat, ensuring that the fiercest warriors rise to command, while the weak are swiftly forgotten."
Kabal_ideas_6:0 "Toil of the Forsaken"
Kabal_ideas_6_desc:0 "Commorragh is built on the agony of the wretched. Its spires rise ever higher on the backs of the enslaved, their ceaseless toil fueling the engines of our dominion. From the arenas to the forges, from the laboratories to the gladiatorial pits, they labor without end, their suffering the lifeblood of our prosperity. They are tools to be broken, replaced, and discarded, but while they last, their misery serves a greater purpose."
Kabal_ideas_7:0 "At Galaxy's End"
Kabal_ideas_7_desc:0 "In the twilight of the cosmos, as stars flicker like dying embers, the Drukhari lay in wait, their eyes fixed on the impending chaos to come. With the galaxy unraveling, the factions are caught in a relentless struggle for dominance, each vying to seize control of the power vacuum. The Drukhari Kabals stand poised to unleash our insatiable thirst for conquest, ready to plunder the remnants of a universe on the brink of annihilation, ready to carve our legacy from the ruins of what once was."

After the dust settles, the survivors will be taken, but not for mercy, but for 'refinement'."

Our bodies are but vessels, beneath the catacombs of Commorragh, in chambers of bio-womb and crystallized ether, thousands of us slumber in reserve, ensuring our dominion extends beyond the constraints of time. We do not fear either the blade, the bullet, or the poison; for we have ensured that our existence is as eternal as suffering itself."
Haemonculi_ideas_4:0 "Bad to the Bone"
Haemonculi_ideas_4_desc:0 "To lesser minds, the body is a fragile prison of bone and sinew. To us, it is an endless, widely available resource, a medium to be refined, reshaped, and perfected to our aims. A spine can be extended, a limb replaced with something far more suited to war, a body fused with a machine until the distinction is meaningless. We do not see flesh or bone as a limitation, but as the first step in an endless transformation, far beyond the comprehension of inferior minds."
Haemonculi_ideas_5:0 "Sin City"
Haemonculi_ideas_5_desc:0 "Pain is the essence of our craft, to sculpt flesh, one must first understand suffering, and no being knows pain as intimately as we do.

Haemonculi_ideas_7_desc:0 "To outsiders, our creations are byproducts of our 'insanity'. They fail to realize that suffering is more than art, it is currency, more valuable than even gold or slaves. The agonized wails of the damned echo through Commorragh’s markets, traded and adquired by those who understand their worth. Our subjects, reshaped, and perfected are sold to the highest bidder, each one a testament to our millenia-long mastery."

Within its halls lie chronicles of ancient horrors, prophecies of doom, and truths that could unravel reality itself. It is said to contain every piece of known lore on Chaos, every failed experiment in taming the Warp, and every folly that doomed huge empires, dragging them screaming into the abyss of madness."
XSN_ideas_2:0 "Last Dance"
XSN_ideas_2_desc:0 "As Harlequins we do not merely fight; as much as perform, weaving through battle like specters in an endless play. Each Masque is a shifting enigma, its warriors moving in perfect synchrony, striking where the enemy least expects before vanishing into the void. Their war is not fought in lines and formations, but in steps and flourishes, a magnificent spectacle of death, written in the blood of the heedless who let their curiosity draw them into their last dance."
XSN_ideas_3:0 "The Library of Babel"
XSN_ideas_3_desc:0 "The books in the Black Library are not part of a dead past, they shape the future. We remember every mistake, every tragedy, and every horror that has ever befallen the galaxy. And if someone is foolish enough to repeat history, they are there to make sure it ends the same way. Those who seek its wisdom believe they can master what they do not comprehend, but we, who have seen the cost of such arrogance, know that very few are worthy of the truth."
XSN_ideas_4:0 "Arcade"
XSN_ideas_4_desc:0 "To the ignorant, we are mere jesters, our lavish performances dismissed as frivolous, heretical theatrics. But beneath the laughter lies a deeper reality, every step, every whisper, every taunt is a carefully crafted deception, drawing all rivals toward an inescapable fate. Clad in our distinctive Agaith, the false faces that hide our true selves, we move with a grace beyond even other Eldar, gliding effortlessly within our grand arcade of war, where every motion is both spectacle and deception."
XSN_ideas_5:0 "The Forgotten Tomes"

But knowing the end of the story doesn’t mean it can’t be changed. The ignorant believe they act of their own will, but they are merely players in the performance we direct. The destiny of the galaxy rests within our grasp, and we alone will decide how the final act unfolds."
XSN_ideas_6:0 "The Harlequin’s Kiss"

XSN_ideas_7:0 "The Aleph"
XSN_ideas_7_desc:0 "Those who seek to possess all knowledge believe it can be contained, that the vastness of truth can be bound within their grasp. But the Black Library is no mere archive, it is a singular point from which all possibilities can be glimpsed, where past, present, and future collide into one. Those who attempt to claim its secrets find themselves consumed by them, lost in an infinite maze of wisdom they cannot hope to wield. It does not belong to anyone. It is not a fortress waiting to be stormed. It is a trap, a graveyard of would-be conquerors, a monument to the arrogance of those who thought themselves its masters, only to become part of its endless history."

Blackened husks of ships drifted in the void, their crews flensed to the bone. On Drucilla Majoris, the sun simply failed to rise. The air grew colder, unnatural obelisks rose from the earth, and then all was lost. Across the sector, worlds vanished into darkness before a single shot was fired. The Necrons have awakened; but we will not go quietly into the night. If we are to fall, then by the Emperor, we will make the enemy remember our name."

XAD_ideas_3:0 "Against all Odds"

By all reason, we should already be dust, but reason does not command this war, desperation does. We seize their weapons, twist their own dark technology to our will, and turn their might against them. As long as we draw breath, this is not over."
XAD_ideas_4:0 "Total War"
XAD_ideas_4_desc:0 "No one escapes the draft. Penal legions fight as the first wave, brought to the front only for the seconds they steal from the enemy. Civilian and merchant ships become war machines overnight, crude weapons bolted onto rusting hulls. The Orphean War is waged with the bodies of the forsaken, those left with no choice but to rise and resist the apocalyptic tide of the Necron menace."
XAD_ideas_5:0 "The Last Stand"

We are not merely defending our territory; we are fighting for our very existence, for the memory of those who came before us. For all of mankind."

The Necrons do not conquer; they erase. It's time to return the favor."

But there is one pact we honor; coin for blood, service for payment. Mercenaries, reavers, and cutthroats of every kind flock to Moebius, drawn by the promise of wealth and the certainty that we will never betray a contract once struck. Where others see dishonor, we see pragmatism.

He does not recognize the authority of the Silent King, nor does he bow to tradition that shackles his kind to the failures of the past. The galaxy will not be tamed by ancient decrees or empty claims to sovereignty. It will be conquered by the one who has the will to take it."
 XEV_ideas_3:0 "Duels of Honor"
 XEV_ideas_3_desc:0 "Imotekh, in battle, will often seek out the enemy commander and engage them in an honour duel, as tradition dictates. However, these duels rarely end in death. Instead, he denies his foes the quiet release of death, leaving them mutilated or gravely wounded. Victory is not merely about crushing an opponent, it is about ensuring they live to bear the weight of their humiliation, forever haunted by the memory of their failure."
 XEV_ideas_4:0 "Vae Victis"
 XEV_ideas_4_desc:0 "In our dynasty, conquest is not just about territorial expansion, but utility. Those who surrender are bound in servitude, their civilizations repurposed to fuel the war machine of the Stormlord. Every captured world is systematically stripped of all resistance. Those who refuse to submit face only one alternative; utter annihilation."
 XEV_ideas_5:0 "Nanoscarabs"
 XEV_ideas_5_desc:0 "A critical asset in Imotekh's arsenal are the Bloodswarm Nanoscarabs. These minuscule scarabs are designed for bloodletting, seeking out weak points in an opponent’s armor. Their objective is not to kill but to spill as much blood as possible, drawing a pack of Flayed Ones into battle. Drawn by the scent of carnage, these ravenous horrors descend upon the battlefield, turning an already grim fate into an unthinkable nightmare for our enemies."
 XEV_ideas_6:0 "Days Gone Bye"
 XEV_ideas_6_desc:0 "In ages past, the Necrontyr were fragile and brittle creatures bound by flesh, shackled to suffering and the unyielding decay of time. Then came the gift of eternity, a transformation that freed us from the shackles of mortality and weakness. To look back now, to long for the chains of the past, is the mark of a fool. The Silent King whispers of salvation, of returning to our golden age, to what was lost. That path leads only to ruin. The strong do not seek to forfeit their strength, nor do the wise reject the blessing that set them above all others. Whilst the misguided dream of flesh and bone, we will forge a future in fire and brimstone."
 XEV_ideas_7:0 "New Cosmic Order"
 XEV_ideas_7_desc:0 "We were built to rule. The lesser beings of the galaxy flounder in their misguided ways, ignorant of the structure that true power demands. To govern the cosmos is to impose discipline, to command it is to shape destiny itself. Under our empire, there is no room for the witless, no tolerance for weakness. Every warrior, every client dynasty must march in unison, for only through absolute control will the Necrons reclaim what was lost so long ago. Order. Unity. Obedience. We taught the galaxy these things long ago, and we will do so again."

 XET_ideas_1_desc:0 "A long time ago, during the War in Heaven, Szarekh's desperation led to a fateful bargain with the C'tan, trading flesh for immortality, and, unbeknownst to him, eternal servitude to the star gods. The Necrontyr were reborn as the Necrons, but at the cost of their souls. Even as they won the War in Heaven against the Old Ones and later crushed the C'tan for their deceit, they ultimately lost themselves. The Silent King would thereafter spend eternity burdened by the consequences of his actions."
 XET_ideas_2:0 "The Great Sleep"
 XET_ideas_2_desc:0 "Victory over both the C'tan and the Old Ones came at a heavy price, for the younger races of the galaxy, like the Aeldari, had risen in the power vacuum that followed. The Necrons, exhausted by aeons of war, could not contend against them. Szarekh had an impossible choice to make; continue the state of perpetual warfare or bide his time and let these new races destroy themselves. He chose the latter, placing the Necrons in stasis within the Tomb Worlds to be awakened once their dominance could be reasserted in earnest."
 XET_ideas_3:0 "Into Infinite Obscurity"
 XET_ideas_3_desc:0 "Szarekh did not join his subjects in their slumber; rather, he wandered the darkness of the void aimlessly. Eventually discovering the Tyranids and the threat they posed to his goal of reversing the curse of biotransference, the Silent King chose to return after millions of years of absence. The long exile gave clarity of purpose to Szarekh, he would reclaim our people's destiny as masters of the stars and, with those resources, reverse the curse that plagues us before the Tyranids condemn us to everlasting torment."

 XET_ideas_7:0 "A House Divided"
 XET_ideas_7_desc:0 "Imotekh the Stormlord vehemently opposes the reversal of biotransference that Szarekh has planned. As the ruler of the Sautekh Dynasty, he is even willing to ally with humans in their wars against us to thwart our goals. This defiance cannot be tolerated. If Imotekh refuses to heed the authority of the Silent King and the counsel of reason, then it will be a war to the death between our dynasties."

XPM_ideas_3_desc:0 "No man rules alone. Vraesque surrounds himself with a body of quick witted liutenants and advisors chosen not for their sycophancy, but for their intellect. These are far from being yes-men, but master schemers and seasoned veterans, each bringing their own unique insights and brinkmanship to the court."
XPM_ideas_4:0 "First Blood"
XPM_ideas_4_desc:0 "Our aerial superiority is built upon a diverse array of elite forces. From contracted Razorwing squadrons to precision bomber crews and the ever-present Scourges, each plays a vital role in our campaigns. The Scourges, genetically modified with wings, serve as our swift and deadly jump infantry. Their competition to draw first blood is infamous for its sheer brutality upon their unfortunate victims."
XPM_ideas_5:0 "Infinity Edge"
XPM_ideas_5_desc:0 "The pilots in our service understand the ever-present Damocles sword hanging over them. Flawless performance brings prestige and ample rewards, but failure is met with merciless retribution. They all remember the fate of those responsible for the debacle at Percival II, where Vraesque fell due to their incompetence, only to return and personally hunt down every last one who had failed him."
XPM_ideas_6:0 "Crimson Customs"
XPM_ideas_6_desc:0 "It is customary among our warriors to anoint their armor with their own blood before battle, a ritual of defiance, as many boast it will be the only blood of theirs spilled that day. As for enemy reinforcements, they often lose the will to fight upon witnessing their predecessors still standing at their posts, stripped of their skins."
XPM_ideas_7:0 "The Spearsworn"
XPM_ideas_7_desc:0 "The Spearsworn are the warrior elite among us, seasoned veterans, forged in the fires of dozens of raids, whose skill and loyalty is beyond question. They swear unwavering fealty to our Archon at the tip of his spear, Sorrowthirst, a pledge sealed in spilled blood of the past and the bright future ahead."
