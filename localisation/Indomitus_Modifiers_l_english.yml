warp_ftl:0 "Warp-Based FTL"
warp_ftl_desc:0 "Warp-based travel is unreliable at best and dangerous at worst. Ships remain reliant on Gellar Fields to traverse the Warp unscathed but are subject to malfunctions. Fleets are also unable to enter or exit systems without traveling at sublight speeds to a Mandeville Point, greatly hindering mobility relative to Eldar and Necron methods of travel."
webway_ftl:0 "Webway-Based FTL"
webway_ftl_desc:0 "Eldar faster-than-light travel relies on navigating portals through a pocket dimension known as the Webway. While the forgone Aeldari Empire and its remnants are adept at navigating the Webway's complex network of arteries and capillaries, the static nature of its portals renders such means less effective than the Necrons' portable Intertialess Drives."
ether_drive_ftl:0 "ZFR Horizon Accelerator Engine"
ether_drive_ftl_desc:0 "The T'au, weilding neither the psychic potential of humans necessary for Warp-based travel nor the knowledge to navigate the Eldar webway, have yet to achieve faster-than-light capabilities. Initial experimentation with the technology via the AL-38 Slipstream Module was placed on hiatus following the mass displacement of settlers involved in the Fourth Sphere of Expansion. The empire has thus continued relying on the ZFR Horizon Accelerator Engine, a propulsion system only capable of reaching near-light speed."
